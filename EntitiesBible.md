# Future Blocs / Major Political-Economic Entities

* **North America and East Asia Alliance (NAEA)** - US–Mexico Federation + Japan/Korea Bloc – Unified federal framework for North America and East Asia (except Taiwan), with mixed economic integration and lingering cultural-political frictions.
* **New Commonwealth** – India at the helm, UK along for a ride, Canada loose member ; Australia out, now in a new bloc with NZ & Philippines.
* **Unified China Confederacy** – Loosely bound economic-political confederation, Taiwan as a "special/privileged status" member, plus odd Pacific and African partner states for strategic reach.
* **Baltic Alliance** – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania punching above weight through tech, logistics, and naval proxy power. Partner status with ECS.
* **South Pacific Accord (SPA)** - Australia–NZ–Philippines Pact – Small but agile maritime alliance focused on Pacific trade routes and disaster-response leverage.
* **The European Convention of States (ECS)**– Not all members signed full membership yet; San Marino as a hyper-specialized neutral arbiter state. Baltic states left but retained partner status.
* **Global Commodities Council (GCC)** - Basically OPEC+Russia – Expanded from oil into all strategic commodities (oil, gas, hydrogen, food); forever on the edge of being a serious bloc but riddled with over-voting everything. Siberia converted into mega-agricultural hub, exporting food and grain at scale.
## **The European Convention of States (ECS)**

### **History**

- **Crisis Cascade (mid–21st century)** – A decades-long spiral of economic stagnation, performative politics, and infrastructure fragility. Trigger points:
    - Bankruptcy declarations from several member states → EU-wide fiscal panic.
    - Hyperinflation after the central bank attempted a “self-bailout” through uncontrolled printing.
    - Mass capital flight following hostile corporate and wealth regulations in some states; wealth never returned.
    - Infrastructure collapse after huge “green anything” investments ignored upkeep costs.
    - Cultural and linguistic fragmentation after decades of unmanaged migration and declining native-language use.
    - “Outcome equality” laws reaching absurdity — competitive sports and professional rankings decided by lottery.
- **Reformation Pact (post-crisis)** 
	- During the cascade, insurers demanded a **neutral registrar**; San Marino’s stack became the legal substrate for treaty filings → later formalized as **constitutional arbitration**.
	- Poland and France forged a deal to impose stopgap reforms. 
	- The only way others agreed: appointing **San Marino** as a _neutral constitutional arbiter_, with heavy AI role. San Marino had already built a reputation mediating smaller disputes, but now scaled up to bloc-wide arbitration.

### **Current Situation**

- **Governance System**
    - Each member state maintains a **State Avatar** — a policy alignment model aligned with domestic positions - as well as modular domain avatars (Fiscal, Compliance, Logistics, etc)
    - For any proposal, the Avatars exchange positions, align points of consensus, and submit the data to the **Deep Policy AI Register** (unofficial nickname: _"The Register"_).
    - The Register produces immediate and second-order scenario projections, with nuanced recommendations.
    - **San Marino’s Arbiters** use these projections to deliver **Rulings** (binding, narrow scope) and **Guidances** (non-binding, used for delay/face-saving).
    - This “Avatars → Register → Arbiters” chain is sold to the public as _absolutely neutral_ — and San Marino’s leadership is determined to keep that reputation, knowing it’s their ticket to long-term relevance.
    
- **Political Landscape**
    - **Reformationists** – Mixed coalition driving the functional federal core. Split between _Mainstream_ (pragmatic reformers) and _Radical_ factions (e.g., German “Right-Ummah” Islamists). Radicals' price for backing federal procedure is often **local jurisprudence carve-outs**, so they are frequently at odds with Mainstream Reformationists.
    - **Planet/Equality Coalition** – Former green/equality activists turned geo-engineering advocates; now campaigning for coal plants, methane heavy industries, and atmospheric seeding to stave off a forecasted ice age (Milankovitch cycles)
    - Persistent resentment between factions; some states have nearly purged Planet/Equality politics, others keep them in cabinet.
        
- **Socioeconomic State**
    - Infrastructure remains fragile but stabilized; prestige megaprojects continue under rebranded “resilience” initiatives.
    - Cities are linguistic patchworks; many lack a native-language majority.
    - Border control varies wildly between states; some apply discretionary, politically motivated restrictions.
    - San Marino’s arbitration is now the federation’s **political heartbeat** — and a potential point of vulnerability if the neutrality image ever cracks.

### Notes

**1. The "Why San Marino?" Question (Monetized Neutrality)**
* **Pre-Crisis Niche:** For decades before the cascade, San Marino invested heavily in becoming the world's premier **digital arbitration hub**. They offered legally binding, AI-assisted mediation for ultra-complex corporate disputes, patent wars, and insurance defaults. Their key selling point was **absolute, incorruptible neutrality, backed by impenetrable data security.**
* **Incentive:** Their entire national economy is now built on this reputation. Their sovereignty and prosperity depend on being seen as the only honest broker left. Any hint of bias would shatter their one and only strategic asset. This makes them paradoxically the most trustworthy and the most ruthlessly self-interested actor in the ECS.
* **Vulnerability:** This is their critical weakness. If a rival bloc or internal faction could successfully frame the Arbiters or their AI as compromised—even with fake evidence—it could trigger the ECS's constitutional collapse.

**2. The Role of "The Register" and Human Incentives**
* **Garbage In, Garbage Out:** The Register is only as good as the data fed to it by the State Avatars. Lobbyists, corporate interests, and political factions within each member state don't try to bribe the Arbiters in San Marino—that's impossible. Instead, they focus all their energy on **skewing the data their national Avatar submits to The Register.** The real political battles are fought in the obscure data-vetting committees in Warsaw, Paris, and Berlin.
* **The "Human" Arbiters:** The Sammarinese Arbiters aren't just rubber-stamping AI outputs. Their job is to interpret The Register's projections and make a ruling that **preserves the stability of the system (and thus, their own authority)**. They often choose the "least controversial" or "most reversible" option, leading to frustratingly cautious and incremental policies. They are masters of the strategic delay and the non-binding resolution.

 **3. Military & Geopolitical Posture**
* **The "Joint Enforcement Fleet":** The ECS doesn't have a true unified military. It has a "Compliance Fleet"—a patchwork of nationally-owned assets operating under their state ops command but a shared procedural framework managed by The Register.
* **Strengths:** They are masters of **bureaucratic warfare**. Their ships may be mediocre, but their legal avatars can bury a rival fleet in so much regulatory paperwork that it can't leave port without violating a dozen treaties. They excel at sanctions enforcement, quarantine protocols, and insurance liability actions.
* **Weaknesses:** They are rarely capable of swift, decisive action. Any order for kinetic engagement would require a qualified alignment from subscribed seats, and a binding ruling from San Marino. They are a glass cannon made of paperwork. 

#### **Refined Faction Breakdown & Reaction to the Alien Mystery**

| Faction                                           | Core Motivation                                                                                                                                                                              | How They React to the Alien Mystery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Reformationists** (Franco-Polish Core)      | **Stability at all costs.** Preserve the fragile union. Prevent a repeat of the Crisis Cascade. They are the ultimate institutionalists.                                                     | **As a Threat.** The alien find is a source of unpredictable chaos. They would push for extreme containment, information control, and suppression of "hype." Their State Avatars would feed The Register data emphasizing economic risk and social instability. They want to classify it, regulate it, and bury it under a mountain of procedural committees.             |
| **The Planet/Equality Coalition** (Geo-Engineers) | **Opportunistic Relevance.** Having lost the climate debate, they are desperate for a new existential narrative to put themselves at the center of.                                          | **As an Opportunity.** They rebrand as "Exo-Resilience" experts. The alien find is proof of unknown cosmic dangers, justifying massive, ECS-funded prestige projects: planetary defense grids, new sensor arrays, "First Contact Protocols"—anything that gives them budget and influence. Their Avatars would feed The Register data focused on "xeno-threat scenarios." |
| **The Autonomists** (Regional & Populist)         | **Distrust of the Center.** They believe the Avatar-Register system is a bureaucratic cage that stifles national identity and sovereignty. They resent the power of the Reformationist core. | **As Proof of Incompetence.** They would use the ECS's slow, gridlocked response as a rallying cry. "The bureaucrats in San Marino are dithering while humanity's future hangs in the balance!" They would support rogue missions, leak classified data to stir up panic or excitement, and push for national control over any alien-related assets or research.          |

#### **The Resulting Gridlock:**

When the Enceladus artifact surfaces:

1.  The State Avatars would submit wildly conflicting data to The Register.
2.  The Register would project dozens of high-risk, contradictory scenarios (economic collapse vs. tech boom; religious war vs. secular unity).
3.  The Sammarinese Arbiters, seeing no "safe" path forward and fearing any decisive ruling would shatter their neutrality, would issue the most cautious, ambiguous, and non-committal judgment possible: **"Further study is required under existing multilateral frameworks."**

The ECS is therefore slow on **policy**, fast on **custody**.
- They excel at seals, throttles, escrows - they would produce the galaxy's most exquisitely detailed and legally sound **treaties, regulations, and liability frameworks** .
- But they stall on funding/missions -  unable to fund a major mission or take a clear stance. 
- This makes them a frustrating but essential partner for any other bloc that actually wants to *do* something.

## Baltic Alliance

**History (50 years before Book 1)** 
- During the EU/ECS Crisis Cascade, the Baltic states quit full ECS membership after a string of chaotic, pre–San Marino arbitrations in which rotating member-state panels issued contradictory rulings on the same disputes within months. In one case, port-quota rights they’d just won were overturned without explanation, sparking a public feud and walkout. Retaining partner status, they pivoted into a tightly coordinated naval/logistics alliance, leveraging location and tech expertise. They capitalized on early space-corridor commerce, winning lucrative hazard-modeling and compliance-audit contracts. These successes delivered prestige and cash far above their size, embedding the expectation that they could always supply actionable traffic-risk data to larger blocs.

**Current Situation (Book 1)** 
- Politically agile and unbound by full ECS arbitration, the Alliance balances ties with ECS, major powers, and niche partners. Its economy leans heavily on sustaining the demand for risk-assessment and corridor-security services; any drop in perceived hazards would hit budgets hard. They maintain a small but advanced compliance-escort and survey fleet, valued more for speed and precision than firepower, and face internal division between diversification-minded pragmatists and maximalists pushing ever-larger “risk-mapping” campaigns.

## GCC (OPEC + Russia)

**History (50 years before Book 1)**:
- Built on oil, gas, hydrogen, and food exports, the bloc consolidated control over strategic commodities through coordinated pricing and infrastructure agreements. This **Export Leverage Peak** gave them treaty influence far beyond their military reach. Emboldened, they launched a **Resource Boom Optimism** era — heavily subsidizing asteroid mining claims, lunar refining hubs, and Siberian mega-farms, convinced their commodity wealth could seamlessly extend into space dominance.

**Current Situation (Book 1):**
- Riding high on record export revenues and a wave of prestige project announcements, OPEC+Russia presents itself as both Earth’s energy backbone and a future space superpower. Internally, the leadership enjoys rare unity, with Gulf states, Russia, and agrarian partners aligned behind the expansion vision. Early technical setbacks are kept quiet, framed as “expected teething issues” in a bold multi-decade plan.

## South Pacific Accord (SPA) - Australia, NZ, Philippines

**History (50 years before Book 1):**
- Amid Chinese political fragmentation and South China Sea instability, pacific maritime nations sought to renew corridor stability. Australia and New Zealand partner with the Philippines to build the **South Haven Project** — a sprawling joint naval base and logistics hub in the southern Philippines, designed as the world’s most advanced humanitarian and disaster-response center. Officially for cyclone relief and maritime rescue, it was quietly built with military-grade docks, fuel depots, orbital tracking arrays, and launch platforms for small-payload missions. The success of South Haven cemented the South Pacific Accord (SPA) as a permanent maritime bloc, with the base becoming both a symbol of unity and the nucleus for dual-use capabilities that would later underpin SPA’s opportunistic corridor control.

**Current Situation (Book 1):**
- SPA markets itself as the indispensable guardian of Pacific maritime stability and first responder for the southern hemisphere. South Haven remains its crown jewel — a bustling humanitarian hub in public perception, but in practice a fully operational military and space-support facility. Fleet tenders, patrol craft, and logistics ships cycle through its docks under disaster-response livery, while its launch pads and tracking stations are kept “on standby” for emergencies. Behind the scenes, SPA leadership uses the base to quietly expand their reach, leveraging jurisdiction gaps between major blocs to secure long-term access rights and stage assets for opportunistic moves.

## **New Commonwealth (NC)**

**History (50 years before Book 1)**

* The modern Commonwealth re-formed after the UK suffered a second sovereign debt collapse — this time without a US bailout. India, already the bloc’s largest economy and fastest-growing power, stepped in to stabilize shared markets and debt structures. In the *quietest coup in bloc history*, operational leadership shifted to New Delhi. The UK retained the ceremonial presidency and “prestige” functions, hosting annual summits and serving as the bloc’s diplomatic face in old-guard circles, while India became the bloc’s economic and strategic engine. Over the next decades, NC focused almost entirely inward: continental freight corridors, space-based solar grids, climate stabilization, and deep-sea port upgrades. These projects created immense industrial capacity but consumed nearly all political bandwidth and launch capability. 

**Current Situation (Book 1)**

* Economically powerful and internally stable, NC is respected but not yet feared in inter-bloc politics. India quietly directs bloc policy while letting the UK play the role of “elder statesman.” Most of NC’s space assets still serve Earth infrastructure — orbital energy, weather, and resource mapping — but the industrial and launch base now exists for rapid expansion. Internal debates are building over whether to keep the inward focus or make a prestige move onto the space stage.

## NAEA (North America and East Asia Alliance)

**History (50 years before Book 1)**
* NAEA emerged from a gradual tightening of security and economic ties between the US, Japan, Korea, and Mexico. The US had been in slow economic decline for decades, with overstretched defense commitments and a shrinking labor base. Japan and Korea faced demographic collapse and rising Pacific threats after Chinese political fragmentation. Mexico’s integration came more naturally: decades of supply-chain interdependence and labor-sharing agreements had already blurred economic borders. By the time the US–Mexico “labor-energy pact” was formalized, they were operating as a single industrial system. NAEA was sold as a mutual defense and economic resilience bloc — and while the US remained its largest player, it was a partnership of equals in critical sectors from the start.

**Current Situation (Book 1)**
* NAEA projects confidence as one of the most technologically advanced and operationally integrated blocs. The US still claims bloc leadership in public, but real decisions often come from trilateral committees where Japan’s tech leverage and Mexico’s manufacturing base carry equal weight. Early in the alien-mystery era, NAEA has been the main underwriter of first-wave missions — funding large-scale expeditions, station modules, and orbital logistics contracts to cement strategic prestige. This spending has kept their orbital yards and crews working at full capacity, but the pace is unsustainable. Skilled orbital labor is already tight, with training pipelines lagging behind mission demand. By the next decade, this shortage will trigger an **orbital labor crisis**, forcing NAEA to pivot away from deep-space dominance toward emergency recruitment and retention measures — a shift that will directly feed into the “big push” for origins.

## UCC (Unified China Confederacy)

**History (50 years before Book 1)**
* China entered the mid-21st century under mounting strain: slowing growth, demographic collapse, environmental degradation, and rising maritime disputes. The breaking point came with a **maritime resource collapse** in the South and East China Seas, followed by an **OPEC+Russia export embargo** that choked energy and food imports.
* In a bid to keep the economy alive, Beijing issued **Regional Autonomy Charters**, granting provinces wide control over trade, industry, and local security. Intended as temporary crisis measures, these charters entrenched autonomy — provinces built independent supply chains, negotiated their own port deals, and quietly shifted loyalty to regional leadership. **Coastal fleets were quietly reassigned to provincial command during the charters, nominally still under central orders.**
* Taiwan, watching **New Commonwealth** and **South Pacific Accord** expand their maritime influence, concluded that isolation would leave it squeezed between two rising naval powers. New Commonwealth and South Pacific Accord patrols began “freedom of navigation” transits through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait, shadowing Taiwanese merchant convoys and running electronic mapping sweeps near undersea cables. Officially routine, these drills forced Taiwan’s navy into costly constant escort duty.
* Facing its own import vulnerabilities, Taiwan opened talks with Beijing’s weakened central government. Both sides saw advantage: Taiwan would gain guaranteed fleet basing rights, trade access, and inclusion in foreign policy planning; Beijing could claim a **“historic reunification”** and secure Taiwan’s naval and tech assets for the bloc.
* The resulting **Unified China Confederation (UCC)** treaty framed the union as a bilateral pact between “China” and Taiwan, but in practice provinces retained high autonomy under their original charters, and several **debt-dependent Pacific and African partners** were folded in as associate members.

**Current Situation (Book 1)**
* The UCC presents itself as a newly unified maritime power, but beneath the rhetoric it operates as a coalition of near-independent provinces and Taiwan’s autonomous state apparatus. The **Confederation Council** manages foreign policy and coordinates naval deployments, but provincial economic agendas dominate day-to-day governance. Coastal fleets still answer primarily to local authorities, with “central” orders requiring consensus from multiple power centers.
* Taiwan’s integration has brought advanced shipbuilding, electronics manufacturing, and its world-leading specialty in ultra-reliable, space-rated semiconductors into the bloc, giving UCC a technical edge over many mid-tier rivals. This creates low-grade friction with **NAEA**, which now depends on UCC-linked supply chains for critical orbital systems despite viewing the bloc as a strategic competitor.
* In return, Taiwan enjoys Council-backed security guarantees and basing rights across the bloc’s network of African and Pacific partner ports.
* The bloc is in a **post-instability rebuild phase** — consolidating trade routes, repairing neglected infrastructure, and quietly expanding maritime patrol range. Internally, debates over whether to centralize more authority or preserve provincial autonomy remain unresolved, but for now the shared need to counter **New Commonwealth** and **SPA** naval expansion keeps the bloc aligned.



## Bloc Dynamics

The geopolitical landscape is defined by a fragile, multi-polar balance of power. The era of unilateral dominance is over, replaced by a complex web of strategic dependencies, commercial rivalries, and grudging cooperation. No single bloc possesses the capability to pursue its grand ambitions alone; each is constrained by a **hard strategic ceiling**—a critical capability gap that only a rival can fill. This dynamic of mutual necessity forces all players into a state of constant, cynical negotiation, where today’s partner is tomorrow’s competitor.



### Core Tensions & Dependencies

The balance of power is not static; it is defined by a series of critical, often conflicting, relationships rooted in the strategic ceilings above.

#### The Pacific Rivalry: NAEA ↔ UCC
This is the system's primary "cold war," a **competitive dependency** for technological and military dominance. The core friction is a profound strategic vulnerability: despite being rivals, **NAEA is critically dependent on the UCC's world-leading, ultra-reliable space-rated semiconductors** for its advanced orbital systems. This gives the UCC a powerful, non-military lever and represents a critical supply-chain capture. In return, the UCC lacks the heavy-lift capacity to sustain major operations and often relies on NAEA's industrial throughput.

#### The Economic Backbone: NC ↔ GCC ↔ SPA/NAEA
The relationship between the NC and GCC is one of pure **codependence**. The **GCC controls the raw fuel and food** molecules, while the **NC owns the advanced orbital depots and infrastructure** to move those resources. This bilateral relationship, however, collapses beyond GEO. For any sustained deep-space operation, they require **SPA's forward staging bases** to position assets and **NAEA's orbital assembly capacity** to build the necessary infrastructure. This strategic triangle ensures that no single bloc can control the entire economic pipeline.

#### The Middle Power Axis: SPA ↔ Baltic Alliance
As the system's opportunists, SPA and the Baltic Alliance share the goal of preventing the "Big Three" from dominating, but they employ distinct levers. **SPA leverages its physical position**, trading access rights to its South Haven staging base for political influence and favorable contracts. The **Baltic Alliance leverages its technical expertise**, selling high-fidelity hazard models and compliance escort services, often operating under the legal color of its partnership with the ECS.

#### The Levers of Power: Custody and Through-Path Rights
Non-kinetic conflict is constant and waged through procedural levers. A key tactic is the control of **through-path rights** for communication. A bloc that owns or leases a ground-segment uplink can lawfully **"pause" or throttle** a rival's data traffic under the guise of safety codes or contractual disputes. This is not jamming; it is a legal, procedural chokehold.

These disputes are sometimes arbitrated by the ECS, whose doctrine is "**slow on policy, fast on custody**". All conflicts route through the established machinery: member-state **Avatars** submit conflicting data to the **Deep Policy AI Register**, and the **Sammarinese Arbiters** issue a binding ruling or a non-binding guidance. While the ECS is too slow to direct military operations, it excels at issuing the **seals, escrow holds, and uplink throttles** that can paralyze a rival's logistics for months. Other blocs have learned to weaponize this procedural lag.


### The Pre-History of the RCC

The Ruling Council did not appear in a vacuum. The strategic ceilings that define the blocs had already forced them into a state of reluctant cooperation for years prior to the rogue probe crisis. The system was rife with **grudging joint drills, emergency data-sharing agreements, and fragile multi-bloc treaties** designed to manage earlier crises where no single power could act alone. These ad-hoc arrangements were inefficient and prone to collapse, but they established the precedent for collective action.

When the Enceladus crisis created an existential threat that demanded a unified response, the formation of the RCC was not an invention, but a desperate **formalization** of these pre-existing, unstable protocols. It was a last-ditch effort to turn years of cynical, temporary handshakes into a standing body capable of acting with the necessary speed and authority.

# Locations of Interest (Solar System)
## **L5 Lagrange Point (Earth-Moon System)**
* **Type:** Primary Inner-System Commercial Hub & Port.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * Functions as a "parking volume" for a cluster of stations, depots, and relay outposts due to its gravitational stability.
    * Massive automated warehouses for storing bulk cargo arriving from Slow-Spiral convoys.
    * Cross-docking facilities to transfer time-sensitive goods from slow freighters to faster shuttles.
    * Likely site for major beamed energy arrays (laser or microwave) to assist with ship departures and arrivals.
* **Strategic Role:** The "Singapore or Rotterdam" of cislunar space; a major choke point for commerce, customs, and liability transfers.

## **Jupiter System**
* **Type:** The Strategic "High Ground" for Outer-System Transit.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * A network of unmanned, automated staging depots and refueling stations ("gas stations") in stable orbits.
    * These depots are essential for enabling the **Oberth Maneuver**, where ships refuel before a powered dive into Jupiter's gravity well for a massive speed boost.
    * Possible location for advanced fusion-powered beam arrays to assist deep-space missions.
* **Strategic Role:** Control of the Jovian depots is tantamount to control of the fast lanes to the entire outer solar system. Access is a critical point of political contention and insurance negotiation.

## **Phobos & Deimos (Mars System)**
* **Type:** Primary Launch and Logistics Node.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * **Mass Drivers ("Mag Cannons"):** Their low gravity makes Mars's moons the ideal location for the massive electromagnetic accelerators that launch refueling pods and other cargo.
    * **Momentum-Exchange Tethers:** "Rotovators" that can catch incoming pods from the mass drivers and fling them onto new trajectories, enabling complex, propellant-free maneuvers.
    * Likely hosts major beamed energy arrays for the Earth-Mars transit corridor.
* **Strategic Role:** The key hub for "cheating" the rocket equation. The infrastructure here is what makes the Sprint Network's mid-flight refueling and high performance possible.

## **Ceres (Main Asteroid Belt)**
* **Type:** Forward Staging Point & Mid-System Hub.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * A logical site for momentum tethers to assist with cargo transfers between the inner and outer systems.
    * Likely hosts fusion-powered outer-system beam arrays, extending the reach of the beamed power network beyond Mars.
* **Strategic Role:** A critical node connecting the industrial centers of the inner system with the resource frontiers and strategic locations of the outer system.

## **Saturn System (Primarily Titan)**
* **Type:** Major Outer-System Destination & Operational Hub.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * **Aerocapture Facilities:** The presence of Titan's atmosphere makes it the primary location for **aerocapture** maneuvers, where arriving ships use atmospheric drag to brake into orbit, saving enormous amounts of fuel.
    * Propellant depots and refineries to support operations in the Saturnian system.
    * Likely hosts arrival-focused infrastructure, such as beamed energy arrays for braking assistance.
* **Strategic Role:** The main gateway to Saturn. Access to its aerocapture corridors is heavily regulated by insurers and is a critical component of any fast-transit mission plan.

## **Enceladus**
* **Type:** Scientific Outpost & Site of Interest.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * The infrastructure here is not primarily industrial or military but scientific, built in response to the initial anomaly detection.
    * Includes monitoring arrays, subsurface drilling rigs, and forensic laboratories dedicated to studying the alien artifact.
* **Strategic Role:** The catalyst for much of the system's technological and infrastructural development. While not a hub itself, the "Enceladus Forensics" effort justifies the existence of many other assets.


## **Vesta Ring**

An early Belt installation built into Vesta’s co-orbital corridor. The ring is a patchwork of industrial nodes, docking arrays, and salvage depots, serving as both logistics checkpoint and contractor foothold. In Trilogy-1 it is already showing signs of under-funding and over-extension, a waystation whose prestige origins are eroded by liability disputes and throughput pressures.


# Bases and Stations

## **Relay 6B (Earth/Luna L5)**

A dusty, under-used compliance outpost at the Earth/Luna L5 point, originally built as a relay node for interplanetary cargo tracking. By the time of the Incident it is a half-forgotten backwater, staffed with low-tier clerks and aging AI systems. Its decaying oversight infrastructure and mismatched protocols made it prone to audit conflicts, culminating in the seal breach that first trapped the hero’s fallback paperwork inside the custody chain.

## **Tethys Station (Saturn System)**

A fragile, prestige-driven orbital hub established by GCC near Saturn’s moon Tethys. It functions as both refueling depot and early staging platform for the Enceladus expeditions. Operational but under-resourced, it represents the prestige-politics of the Big Push: expensive, half-finished, constantly leveraged as “presence” rather than capability.

## **Themis Station (Outer-A Ring)**

A neglected station node on asteroid Themis, serving primarily as a regulatory anchor and insurance checkpoint for Outer-A traffic. Remote, low-prestige, and perpetually short-staffed, it becomes one of the hero’s humiliating billets during his “Lieutenant Fallback” years, where his diligence is treated as nuisance rather than asset.

## **Logistics Annex (Deimos Orbit)**

A clerical graveyard node tethered to Deimos orbit, processing overflow packets from Mars logistics. Functionally irrelevant yet administratively necessary, it absorbs variance disputes and low-priority custody files. Officers assigned here are nominally in command but in practice forgotten, tolerated ballast to keep insurance overlays satisfied.

## **Ceres Transit Yard**

A sprawling orbital holding volume in high Ceres orbit, used to park salvage convoys, abandoned modules, and disputed cargo awaiting clearance. The “yard” is less a station than a skeletal network of docking trusses, tether frames, and drifting hulks kept in controlled orbit by drones. It is administratively tied to Ceres proper but physically isolated.

## **Ceres Hub (Station Complex in Ceres Orbit)**

The central administrative and habitation complex in Ceres orbit, grown over decades into a patchwork of arbitration halls, contractor docks, and bloc enclaves. It functions as the political and procedural heart of the mid-Belt: all major salvage disputes, liability claims, and insurance carve-outs eventually funnel here. While the Transit Yard handles hulks and cargo physically, Ceres Hub proper handles the paperwork — a dense bureaucracy of subcommittees and review boards. Officers seconded here gain exposure to the system’s core machinery, where precedent and compromise outweigh clean procedure.


# Ships

- **Kite’s Wake (Convoy Escort)**
	A small nuclear-thermal escort vessel, built to meet treaty staffing minima rather than heavy combat. With only two commissioned officers aboard, the rest of her complement is a mix of warrant staff, contract crew, and automated systems. Her role is deterrence and procedural enforcement, ensuring convoys carry the proper stamps and can claim bloc protection. Kite’s Wake becomes the hero’s first true billet, where his fallback entanglement escalates into an acting commission during the blackout at Enceladus.

- **Celestial Venture (Convoy Freighter)**
	A mid-sized freighter designed for long-haul cargo runs under steady nuclear-electric drive. Too slow and fragile for prestige routes, she serves as a catch-all hull for priority shipments not trusted to automation. Crewed convoys like hers move specialty hardware and sensitive cargo where human custodial witnesses are contractually required. The hero rides her during his first convoy assignment, learning that even “routine” freight is a web of insurance riders and bloc disputes.

- **Reliant Horizon (Convoy Vessel)**
	A mid-tier convoy ship operating as logistics and compliance platform for Belt runs. Neither glamorous nor strategically critical, it represents the kind of workhorse hull where junior officers are rotated to satisfy treaty staffing quotas. The hero’s transfer aboard her reinforces his status as ballast rather than asset.

# Institutions

- **ECS Navy Academy**
	The bloc’s formal officer pipeline, split between a ceremonial surface campus at Marne Heights near Paris and a utilitarian training complex at Earth–Moon L2. Designed as much to satisfy insurers and treaty auditors as to produce competence, it emphasizes spotless attendance and certification throughput over practical skill.
	- **Marne Heights Campus (near Paris, Earth)**
		A ceremonial campus on the outskirts of Paris, maintained more for political symbolism than training value. The Marne Heights campus hosts opening convocations, bloc dignitary visits, and formal graduations — manicured grounds designed to reassure terrestrial parliaments that officers remain rooted in tradition. Instruction here is limited to lectures and public drills, while most academic content is delivered by AI feeds. For cadets, the Paris term is more about optics than competence, a ritual step before being shunted to orbit.
	- **L2 Orbital Campus**
		The operational heart of the Academy, a spartan training complex at Earth–Moon L2. Here cadets cycle through recycled corporate compliance modules, convoy code refreshers, and AI-screened aptitude drills under the supervision of overworked instructors. Political pressure to maintain pass rates, combined with insurance mandates for spotless attendance and record-keeping, has turned the L2 campus into a bureaucratic treadmill: efficient at producing “certified” officers on paper, but with little guarantee of practical skill. It is here that the hero stumbles through his accelerated crash course, terrified but carried along by system inertia.
