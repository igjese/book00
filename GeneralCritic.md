| **World & Genre**          | Hard sci-fi, near-future tech. Culture is not wildly alien ‚Äî feels like an extension of today‚Äôs. Politics and economics are messy but believable, shaped by actual logistics and resource constraints. No ‚Äúmagic tech.‚Äù Sometimes looks conspiratorial, but only because shared incentives nudge many actors in the same direction, creating outcomes that *seem coordinated without any grand plan.* Near-future. No FTL, no reactionless drives. Everything obeys realistic physics: delta-v budgets, comms delays, life support headaches. Problems must be solved by clever engineering, negotiation, or social maneuvering ‚Äî no magic tech.                                                                                                                                             |

| **Voice & style**            | Dark, gritty, occasionally dryly funny. Not grimdark ‚Äî there's underlying compassion. Mix of Bujold‚Äôs insight into people, Reynolds‚Äô gritty vastness, Weber‚Äôs nuts-and-bolts operational detail. Pays obsessive attention to small tactile things: scratched lockers, old keypads, sealant smells.                                                                                                    |
