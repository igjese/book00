## Hero traits by trilogy

| **Core Trait**                                      | **1 — Young (Drafted clerk → junior slog)**                                                      | **2 — Officer (Lt Cmdr → captaincy)**                                                                                   | **3 — Flag (commodore → admiral)**                                                                                         | **4 — Old (grand-admiral → burned out)**                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🛡️ Fundamentally cautious, risk-averse**         | Nervous fallback habit, obsessed with disclaimers & triple checks to hide his insecurity.        | Hardened into slow bureaucracy — stalls ops with disclaimers, ironically gets niche for risky audits nobody else wants. | By now instinctive — fallback overlays run automatically, ironically becomes “safe pair of hands” for stabilizing fiascos. | Calcified into near-reflex; even minor issues buried under disclaimers, half from fear, half from inertia.          |
| **🪞 Mildly insecure about his competence**         | Deeply aware he’s out of depth, hopes meticulous caution will prove his worth.                   | Still compares himself to sharper officers, buries doubts in certifications & fallback trees.                           | Knows he’s not brilliant — but sees that most are also fumbling; masks insecurity with sardonic routine.                   | Self-doubt gone stale: doesn’t question his mediocrity anymore, just clings to old patterns.                        |
| **🤏 Narrow loyalty, very selective**               | Builds a tiny circle (a few shipmates, early niece tie), guards it fiercely, avoids broad bonds. | Circle thins after small betrayals — loyalty hardens to even fewer people, petty vengeance on minor slights.            | Practically no circle left; loyalty redirected to cautious “least harm” plays that preserve familiar fragments.            | Loyalty almost theoretical — remembers old ties with quiet ache, still might shield small players out of habit.     |
| **🧂 Mildly cynical baseline outlook**              | Starts dryly skeptical of systems, half-joking.                                                  | Cynicism deepens: sees how incentives warp decisions, small illusions keep him from burning out.                        | Fully sardonic, sometimes petty — expects incompetence & small greed everywhere, even exploits it to stay safe.            | Almost weary; cynicism becomes a tired assumption, no outrage left, just dry quips.                                 |
| **💔 Instinct to avoid humiliation more than pain** | Terrified of looking incompetent; fallback plans mostly protect reputation.                      | Still fears personal embarrassment more than real disaster; would rather slow ops than risk blame.                      | By now protects *systems* from blowing up, not out of nobility, but because fiascos drag reputations down — including his. | Embarrassment reflex is pure muscle memory — avoids personal humiliation automatically, even when stakes dwarf him. |
| **😬 Dry, self-deprecating humor**                  | Clumsy, nervous mutters to deflect mockery.                                                      | Sharper, more practiced jokes — shields from scrutiny, quietly bonds with his few close ties.                           | Biting, often half-mean, but still primarily self-targeted. Keeps subordinates wary but oddly loyal.                       | Faint, brittle — humor’s there, but mostly to reassure himself he’s still detached.                                 |
| **🍽️ Small comfort routines (same meals, pacing)** | Rigid about small rituals, calms him amid chaos of new navy life.                                | Now absolute habit — maintains same rituals even on new ships, quietly irritates crews.                                 | Rituals almost legendary — officers know “his deck circuits” and predict his exact shifts.                                 | Still does it, slightly slower, more from inertia than comfort.                                                     |
| **📚 Hoarder of fallback systems & notes**          | Starts obsessively organizing old academy notes.                                                 | Hoarding grows into sprawling private overlay system — mixes trivial with critical.                                     | Now vast private archive, ironically used by insurers/regulators to stabilize fiascos.                                     | Carries it out of instinct — half-knows it’s obsolete, but can’t imagine living without it.                         |
| **Subtle nervous tell (thumb on seam)**             | Frequent, obvious when young — marks him as uneasy.                                              | More contained, but still appears when pressured — older officers know it means he’s unsettled.                         | Practically automatic — thumb habit during tense audit sessions or political briefings.                                    | Still does it, even alone; one of last signs he still *feels* anxious.                                              |
| **Quiet fallback pacing**                           | Initially just a nervous crutch, counts steps to soothe himself.                                 | Becomes pedantic low-stakes “exercise,” known paths on every station.                                                   | Recognized routine; staff work around it like he’s a moving piece of old machinery.                                        | Slower, but still methodical; same paths, now slightly hobbled.                                                     |
