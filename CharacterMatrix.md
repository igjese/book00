# Mirror Structure

* Mirrors Fractal structure of NarrativeMatrix
* Hero's character (his tranformation, desire and illusion) vs narrative  lead to an outcome
* Slots must support that outcome
* Slots are then combined and folded into individual characters

# Slots for the Cast

- **System Antagonist** → _Truby’s Central Opposition_: the institutional force that blocks the hero’s need, embodied through procedures or proxies (e.g. "face of the system").
- **Sticky Opponent** → _Truby’s Opponent/Mirror Opponent_: the rival who embodies the same arena, but succeeds where the hero fails, escalating humiliation.
- **Lie-body** → _Weiland’s Lie Incarnate_: the character who teaches or tempts the hero with the central illusion (the false belief).
- **Truth-body (light)** → _Weiland’s Truth Incarnate (early seed)_: the faint voice of the Truth, often dismissed or ridiculed.
- **Mirror** → _Card’s “Sidekick/Peer Mirror”_: reflects the hero’s state back to him, showing what he looks like from the outside.
- **Foil** → _Card’s Contrast Character_: thrives by an opposite strategy, exposing the hero’s chosen path as flawed.
- **Tragic Echo** → _Truby’s “Echo Character”_: imitates the hero’s tactics and collapses, proving the illusion is fatal.
- **Counter-argument Body** → _Weiland’s Counterpoint_: sincerely argues the case for the Lie, defending it as rational or noble.
- **Catalyst** → _Truby’s Inciting Opponent_ / _Weiland’s Shove Into Motion_: forces the hero to risk his current desire, driving him into the next entrapment.
- **Warning Figure** → _Truby’s “Negative Future” / Weiland’s “Ghost of the Lie”_: an older, fossilized character who shows the hero what he will become if he keeps clinging to the illusion.
- **Institutional Walk-ons** → _Card’s “Functionaries”_: background clerks, officers, avatars — living texture of the system, providing friction without carrying arcs.

| **Cynical Mentor**   | Lie-Body                | Warning Figure            | Relic / Foil                  | Faded Echo                      | Starts as the voice of survivable cynicism, but over time becomes a hollow cautionary example of what the hero might turn into.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Holvik**           | Mirror                  | Tragic Echo               | Absence                       | Foil                            | Begins as a younger reflection of the hero, then collapses under the same pressures as a tragic warning, and finally re-emerges as an embittered obstacle to the hero’s path.                                                                                                                           |
| **Niece**            | Truth-body Light        | Catalyst                  | Positive Foil                 | Counter-Force (Stateswoman)     | She outgrows him, adapting where he calcifies, and endures into old age as a respected force — living proof that survival can mean growth, not exhaustion.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Comrade**          | Catalyst                | Mirror Ally               | Tragic Echo                   | Absence                         | Starts as the rare peer who makes him believe he might belong, grows into his closest equal, but collapses later — leaving a void that haunts the hero into his final years.                                                                                                                            |
| **Smug Rival**       | — (not yet present)     | Antagonist / Catalyst     | Echo                          | Positive Mirror / Unlikely Ally | He enters as the ambitious rival who catalyzes the hero’s compromises, collapses into an echo of systemic ruin, then returns scarred as the unlikely ally who reflects what the hero might have been.                                                                                                   |
| **Arrangement**      | Ally (bounded)          | Mirror of Complicity      | Foil of Dependency            | Echo of Exhaustion              | Starts as discreet human closeness, then reflects his own survival compromises, later becomes dependent on his status, and finally fades with him into hollow endurance.                                                                                                                                |
| **Assistant Daemon** | Catalyst                | Foil (procedural)         | Antagonist                    | Echo of Surveillance            | Initially just a tool that pushes him forward, it grows into a procedural Foil — always logging, never forgetting. Later it becomes a true Antagonist, weaponized against him by the system. By the end, it lingers as an impersonal Echo: its records outlive him, a cold continuity he cannot escape. |
| **Grand Antagonist** | Reluctant Enforcer      | Nail in the Coffin        | Admirable Enemy               | True Believer                   | Begins as a fair officer bound by duty, grows into the principled face of the system, and ends as its true believer — the hero’s final adversary, respectable, sincere, and unyielding.                                                                                                                 |
**Dysfunctional Family Vibe** — By Trilogy 4, the long-arc cast (Hero, Smug Rival, Grand Antagonist, fading Mentor, drained Arrangement, and grown Niece) should feel less like discrete opponents/allies and more like a bitter family bound by decades inside the same machine. They bickered, betrayed, obstructed, and occasionally helped one another, but none ever truly escaped. In late scenes — even a funeral or closed committee — they instinctively cluster together, out of habit rather than affection, a silent tableau of people who spent their lives trapped in the same orbit. The effect should be unsettling: not reconciliation, not camaraderie, but the quiet recognition that they _were_ the system, and what remains is a weary family of survivors bound by paperwork and history.
