This Card analysis is also **dead-on**, and it highlights some things neither Truby nor Weiland touched — particularly about **cast function** and **narrative viewpoint as texture**.

### ✅ Where It Fits Beautifully

* **MICE quotient**

  * You’ve already been intuitively running Character + Milieu + Idea + Event together, but Card’s framework formalizes it:

    * **Character Story** = his internal survivalist → reluctant safeguard arc.
    * **Milieu Story** = the System as crucible (your World Arc).
    * **Idea Story** = alien mystery reframed each trilogy (Discovery → Forensics → Origins Hunt → Containment).
    * **Event Stories** = each book’s inciting disaster (audit collapse, sabotage fiasco, audit purge, rogue probe).
  * That makes explicit what you’ve been treating as “pillars” in the matrix. Nice check for balance.

* **Character construction**

  * Ambition / Frustration / Failure / Habits — you’ve basically written this out already in *InnerJourney.md*, but Card’s model is a **sanity check**: every key quirk (thumb on seam, fallback clutter, pacing) is already “Card-approved” as character-revealing *action*.

* **Supporting cast functions**

  * This is where Card adds something neither Truby nor Weiland gave: **labels for purpose**.

    * Soulmate = **mirror**
    * Rival = **catalyst**
    * Holvik (junior auditor) = **tragic echo**
  * That taxonomy would help a lot when you start fleshing out Tier 2/Tier 3 characters. It prevents bloat because each face *has a function in the hero’s web*.

* **Viewpoint handling**

  * Card’s reminder that you can “zoom” (close 3rd, deep penetration, objective, rare omniscient) is tailor-made for *Audit Noir*.
  * Your clipped, bureaucratic tone already thrives on **limited penetration** (close but dry).
  * His suggestion to use **objective viewpoint during promotions** or **omniscient to show the System’s indifference** is gold — that directly adds emotional irony without breaking your tone.

### ⚠️ Gaps or Weak Spots This Reveals

1. **Walk-ons for institutional texture**

   * Card would push you to make sure **every walk-on embodies the institution**: the nutrient-shake clerk, the optical-implant bureaucrat. Right now, you’ve sketched blocs in abstract, but the “faces of bureaucracy” are still thin.

2. **Overlapping cast roles**

   * You may want to check you don’t have too many catalysts and not enough mirrors/echoes. Right now: smug rival (catalyst), soulmate (mirror), Holvik (echo). Who’s the **foil**? Who’s the **warning figure**? That’s where you may want to expand.

3. **Viewpoint discipline**

   * You’re writing in dry, clipped style — but you’ll need to **plan viewpoint shifts in advance**. Otherwise, omniscient cutaways to “System scale” risk feeling like POV breaks. You could build a “Viewpoint Map” per book to decide where deep penetration vs objective vs omniscient moments happen.

### 📌 How It Integrates With Your Materials

* **HeroTimeline** → Already has ambitions/frustrations noted; just re-tag them with Card’s terms.
* **EntityBible (new)** → Could track “faces” by their Card function (mirror, echo, foil, catalyst).
* **Scaffold** → Add a column or tag for “Viewpoint Mode” in critical scenes (deep, objective, omniscient).

👉 Big takeaway:
Card’s lens doesn’t replace Truby/Weiland — it complements them by giving you:

1. **Cast economy** (who matters, why).
2. **Viewpoint levers** (how to control tone + irony).
3. **MICE balance** (check you’re not leaning too hard on world/idea without character payoff).

Would you like me to **cross-map the three analyses (Truby, Weiland, Card)** into one grid — showing what each framework says about *Audit Noir* and where the gaps overlap? That would give you a single diagnostic “control panel.”
