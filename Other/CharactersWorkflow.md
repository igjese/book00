## A Workflow for Characters and Entities in a Multi-Book Epic

This is a systematic process for creating, developing, and tracking a complex cast of characters and the institutions they represent across a long-form narrative series. The goal is to maintain deep consistency and ensure that every character, from a single-scene player to the protagonist, serves a clear and effective purpose.

### Part 1: The Foundation - The Tiered System

The core principle is that not all characters require the same level of detail. We use a **tiered system** to focus creative energy efficiently.

- **Tier 1: Core Characters**
    
    - **Who they are**: The protagonist, his key inner circle (like his niece, Lena), and primary, recurring antagonists (like the rival who gets him court-martialed). These are characters with their own significant arcs.
        
    - **What they get**: A **comprehensive, multi-page Character Bible entry**. This includes their core psychological profile, a dynamic log of their evolution book-by-book, and a detailed map of their relationships.
        
- **Tier 2: Recurring Characters**
    
    - **Who they are**: Supporting cast who appear in multiple books but in a more limited capacity. They are the texture of the world—a specific superior officer, a contractor, or the station professional with a health flag.
        
    - **What they get**: A **"Bible Lite."** This is a one-page summary focusing on their core motivation, their relationship to the hero, and a **consistency log** of their key appearances and interactions to prevent contradictions.
        
- **Tier 3: One-Off Characters**
    
    - **Who they are**: Functional characters who appear in a single book or scene to serve a specific plot purpose, like the panicked freighter captain in Book 5.
        
    - **What they get**: **No bible entry**. Instead, they live in a **Dramatis Personae** (or cast list) at the beginning of the notes for that specific book, with a one-line description of their role and motivation.

### Part 2: The Development Process - From Need to Nuance

This is a three-phase workflow for bringing a new Tier 1 or Tier 2 character to life.

- **Phase 1: Identification (Mapping the Need)**
    
    - First, we identify _where_ a character is needed. We do this by scanning our high-level outlines, like the `FractalStructure.md`, for moments where an abstract institution (a "bloc," a "corporation") takes an action. That action needs a human face. We also scan the `HeroTimeline.md` for moments of direct conflict or interaction—who is the person on the other side of the desk from the hero?
        
- **Phase 2: Initial Development (The One-Pager)**
    
    - Once a need is identified, we create a quick concept. This includes:
        
        1. **Assigning an Archetype**: We start with a pre-defined archetype, like the **"Embodied Authority"** or **"The Opportunist"**.
            
        2. **Defining a Core Motivation**: We answer the question, "What does this person want?" This is always tied to the goals of the entity they represent.
            
        3. **Adding a Humanizing Quirk**: We give them one memorable, non-functional detail to make them feel real.
            
        4. **Determining their Tier**: We decide if this is a Core, Recurring, or One-Off character, which dictates the next steps.
            
- **Phase 3: Deepening and Tracking**
    
    - For Tier 1 and 2 characters, we create their bible entry and begin tracking their journey. We chart a mini-arc for them across the series—do they rise, fall, change? We also log every key interaction with the protagonist to ensure their shared history evolves believably.

### Part 3: Representing Complex Institutions

To handle entities like the ECS, which have "many bodies and many faces," we represent them through the hero's limited perspective using three levels of interaction.

1. **The Immediate Circle (His Unit/Ship)**: This is the day-to-day, personal reality of the institution, shown through fully developed Tier 1 and 2 characters (his CO, his crew).
    
2. **The Command Structure (The "Absent Hammer")**: This is the remote, higher-level power, represented not by people, but by their **orders, policies, and consequences**. We only occasionally see a Tier 2 "Face" on a video call.
    
3. **The Wider Institution (The "Cousins")**: These are other departments and branches (civilian auditors, diplomats). They appear as Tier 2 or 3 "Faces" whose purpose is to create **friction and conflict**, revealing the institution's internal divisions and competing incentives.

### Part 4: The Toolset - Dashboard and Deep Dive

Finally, we use a hybrid system for tracking these interactions over time.

- **The Manual Log (The Dashboard)**: The interaction log in the Character Bible is not an exhaustive transcript. It's a high-level **"Arc Dashboard"** or **"Executive Summary."** It tracks only the pivotal moments that define a relationship's evolution.
    
- **The LLM (The Research Assistant)**: The notebook LLM is our tactical tool for **"deep dives."** Once the dashboard gives us the strategic overview (e.g., "In Book 6, their rivalry becomes hostile"), we use the LLM to instantly retrieve every specific scene, line of dialogue, and detail from the manuscript to inform the current writing.
