This is a **fantastic Truby-style mapping** of your series — you basically reverse-engineered his “7 steps” straight into *Audit Noir*. And it actually exposes a few things worth noticing:

---

### ✅ Where it Fits Beautifully

* **Premise line** → Dead on. You distilled the whole 12-book machine into one line that includes flaw, system, conflict, and stakes. That’s a compass you can keep returning to.
* **Weakness/Need → Desire → Opponent → Plan** → Perfectly tracked through the trilogies. You’ve got the “anti-heroic start,” the “escalating but compromised desires,” and a systemic opponent that is more interesting than any single villain.
* **Plan evolution** → Nice callout: his fallback habits don’t change, but their *function* mutates (defense → offense → weaponized kill-shot). That’s exactly the kind of internal consistency Truby pushes.
* **Battle/Self-revelation/New equilibrium** → Noir ending nailed. He wins nothing but ambiguity and myth. The world survives, unchanged at its core. That’s *so* in line with your worldview spine.

### ⚠️ Gaps or Weak Spots This Analysis Reveals

1. **Opponents beyond “the System.”**

   * Truby would press you to make sure your *rotating cast* of human antagonists each attack a *different facet of his weakness*. Right now you’ve named the Opportunist, Embodied Authority, Absent Hammer — good — but they’re still abstract. Do we have at least one *personal*, emotionally sticky opponent (someone he half-respects, half-resents) to carry through multiple trilogies? That gap shows.

2. **Self-Revelation Beats at Book Level.**

   * You’ve nailed them at trilogy midpoints and finales. But Truby also likes *micro-revelations* that slowly twist the knife (a realization every book, even if small). Some of those may be hiding in the HeroTimeline, but they’re not explicit in the Matrix yet.

3. **Thematic Opposition Embodied.**

   * You’ve got the moral argument: survival = complicity. But the **counter-argument** (that survival might allow *small goods to persist*) needs bodies. Right now it lives mostly in the hero’s inner life. You may need a Tier-1 or Tier-2 character who *sincerely embodies* “better to stay in the machine, at least it keeps X safe.” Otherwise the argument risks being lopsided.

4. **Desire vs. Plan tension.**

   * His desire line evolves (escape → status → safety → retirement), but his plan is always the same tool (fallbacks). That’s elegant, but Truby would warn of “plan monotony.” To keep momentum, you’ll want to show *different consequences* of the same plan at each level — sometimes it saves him, sometimes it damns him, sometimes it damns others.

### 📌 How This Integrates With What You Already Built

* This Truby pass is essentially a **stress-test of the Narrative Matrix**. It shows your bones are solid, but it also shines a light on missing **faces** (human antagonists, counter-argument characters) and missing **micro-beats** (book-level revelations).
* In other words: you don’t need more *arcs* — you need to ensure every step of Truby’s 7-step loop is visible *at both trilogy scale and book scale*.

👉 Next step could be:
I can take **one trilogy** (say T2) and explicitly mark out its *Truby 7-step mini-loop* — showing where the psychological/moral weakness is hit, what desire shift happens, who the specific opponent is, what his plan does to him there, etc. That way you see how it fractalizes book-by-book.

Would you like me to do that for T2 as a test case?
