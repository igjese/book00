# Summary

**Hero arc**  - Goes from a junior position (drafted civilian, ex. provisioning audit assistant) → to captain → to admiral → to semi-retired unwilling power broker. Keeps evolving longer than most, through persistence & adaptive thinking.           

**Main story** - First contact — but with no clear living aliens. Maybe ruins, drifting artifacts, ambiguous signals. Causes local crises that spiral into systemic shifts. No final handshake or space war, just ambiguity driving human incentives.    

**World arc**  - Hyper-today: similar geopolitical blocks, capitalism + rival systems, same religions (but somewhat avoided in the story), core worries are economy / environment / security. Heavily automated (drones, AI aids), but AGI never quite arrived, and AI legally is not allowed to execute, only prepare/recommend. Everything driven by incentives, logistics, old fears in shiny new suits. 

# The Hero

An obsessively cautious, fundamentally mediocre audit clerk, unwillingly drafted, who spends half his career sidelined in dull or humiliating dead-end posts — precisely because he clumsily tries to navigate incentives, triple-checks everything, and second-guesses decisions. Ironically, these same flaws mean when spectacular fiascos hit, he’s the last safe fallback or simply not there to be ruined.

He doesn’t outsmart rivals; he tries to cover his ass out of deep distrust of his own competence, fumbling through local deals and misread incentives. When forced to be decision maker, he protects a small circle and keeps fallback plans stacked — not for vision, just to avoid personal catastrophe. By the end, ground down to a dry husk, he knows it was luck, chaotic systems, and petty fear that left him standing — not brilliance.

Shunned, overlooked, often sidelined, he climbs with painful slowness, accumulating scars and grudges more than rare victories. His trademark caution doesn’t spare him from serious miscalculations, forced gambles, or petty temptations — paying harsh personal costs for chasing quick wins or old illusions.

A lifetime of crises and navigating others' illusions grinds him down to a dry, sardonic husk; by the time he retires into the weary circles of power, he knows it was chaos, fragile systems, and sheer luck — not brilliance — that left him standing, still grimly adapting in a world eager to break sharper men.

# Alien mystery

Decades-long trickle of ambiguous finds — deep ocean echoes, half-fosilized machines, garbled signals — forcing humanity to lurch through cycles of hype, dread, bankruptcies, and half-measures, slowly reshaping global systems without ever offering clear answers. 

Each generation pays vastly more for slightly more, quietly realizing it may take many lifetimes to truly know — if ever. Local overreactions, long dormancies, and sudden revivals keep it unpredictable, ensuring the world never reacts the same way twice.

# How the world reacts

Messy, incentive-driven: top powers can’t afford to ignore it, so they half-invest, build fragile space navies, spin up moral panics and profit booms — only to fall back to skepticism, then restart the cycle, paying a slow colossal price over a century.

Nations and groups adapt, exploit, or reject the mystery in their own ways, guaranteeing uneven winners, spectacular failures, and a few strange pockets of stability.

# World & Genre

Hard sci-fi, near-future tech. Culture is not wildly alien — feels like an extension of today’s. Politics and economics are messy but believable, shaped by actual logistics and resource constraints. No “magic tech.” Sometimes looks conspiratorial, but only because shared incentives nudge many actors in the same direction, creating outcomes that *seem coordinated without any grand plan.* Near-future. No FTL, no reactionless drives. Everything obeys realistic physics: delta-v budgets, comms delays, life support headaches. Problems must be solved by clever engineering, negotiation, or social maneuvering — no magic tech. 

# Voice & style

Dark, gritty, occasionally dryly funny. Not grimdark — there's underlying compassion. Mix of Bujold’s insight into people, Reynolds’ gritty vastness, Weber’s nuts-and-bolts operational detail. Pays obsessive attention to small tactile things: scratched lockers, old keypads, sealant smells.
