# Texture Lexicon (canon-aligned)

### Station / Ship Physicals

* **Sealant Smell** → Faint tang of epoxy and iodine clinging to bulkheads after repairs.
* **Corridor Echo** → Metallic ring from mismatched panels; insulation always a little loose.
* **Lighting Tone** → Bluish audit-white in Navy halls; warmer amber in union-maintained corners; dim green emergency strips common in salvage hulls.
* **Radiator Hum** → Deep, inconsistent bass vibration as thermal loops cycle; a pitch change or sudden rattle is a sign of deferred maintenance.
* **Custody Locker** *(canon term)* → Dented steel box, seals covered with redundant wax/plastic tags, half of them obsolete.
* **Paper Substitute** → **Polymer e-paper overlays** (waxable, hash-addressed) clipped to a **custody slate**; clunky, battery-poor, with slightly sticky edges.

---

### Everyday Life & Culture

* **Food Staples** →

  * **Navy issue:** Powdered stews, rehydrated rice packs, “sealed fruit cubes.”
  * **Union canteens:** Algae-protein fritters, vat-chicken skewers, fried starch with brine sauce.
  * **Prestige blocs:** Ration wine, prestige coffee tokens—always status markers.
* **Smells of Work** → Burnt insulation (from over-cycled panels), solvent-sweet cleaning foam, metallic tang of a fresh weld.
* **Slang** →

  * **“Seal-monkey”** = A junior inspector.
  * **“Fallback man”** = An insult for an obsessive auditor.
  * **“Ghost tags”** = Redundant forms nobody knows the origin of.
  * **“To file-knife someone”** = To sabotage a rival with a well-timed, seemingly innocent procedural filing.
  * **“Chasing the green line”** = Trying to make all icons on an audit report turn green, even if it means fudging data.
* **Habits** → Crews tape personal charms (coins, old pins, religious scraps) above bunks, even in sterilized Navy quarters.

---

### Audit / Bureaucratic Texture

* **Real Forms (drop-in weapons)** → **Safety Case Withdrawal**, **Writs of Non-Navigation**, **Coverage Review Window (URW)**, **Coverage No-Objection (CNO-C)**, **Origins Liability Recovery Schedule (OLRS-27)**.
* **Stamps & Tones** → Auditors use archaic, obsolete alert-pings, treated as private superstitions.
* **Clerk Rituals** → Muttering reference numbers like prayers; lining up pencils before a grilling.
* **Committee Theater** → At least one member always falls asleep during hearings (a running dark joke).
* **Laggy Seals** → The one-second hang everyone feels: **2-of-3 co-sign (Ops/Finance/Compliance)** plus **silence-procedure** clocks ticking toward 17:00Z.

---

### Human Residues

* **Humiliations** → Sweat stains on uniform collars; reused boots with someone else’s initials etched inside; half-peeled warning decals nobody replaces.
* **Small Comforts** → Ritual tea bags re-steeped three times; the same docking-bar song looped for decades; private bunk curtains pinned with leftover forms.
* **Private Archives** → Chain-of-Custody Diaries, Self-Audit Trails, Null-Action Reports—personal encrypted ledgers kept as defensive fallbacks.
* **Superstitions** → Never tear a seal off clean—always leave a scrap for luck. Knock on the airlock rim before undocking. “Never trust a corridor without graffiti.”

---

### Media & Noise

* **Background Broadcasts** → Muted pundits rehearsing hand gestures; endless panel scrolls of casualty insurance rates.
* **Coverage Tickers** → **URW opened** / **CNO-C pending** crawls treated like weather. Crew proverb: **“No CNO-C, no pump.”**
* **Station Murmur** → Corridor chatter in mixed tongues, cut with overhead audit announcements in a flat AI-voice.
* **Union Chants** → Low, tired repetition of clauses during protests: “Coverage before risk. Risk before cut.”

---

### Bloc-Specific Textures

* **ECS** → Legalese as daily speech; quiet hallways like a law library; senior arbiters flaunt antique pens and leather satchels.
* **NAEA** → Sterile efficiency; faint ozone from overworked servers; public screens show metrics and quotas instead of news.
* **UCC** → Cutting-edge gear nested in patched legacy infrastructure; hot-metal/welding smell near ports; signage: “Our Corridor,” “Collective Benefit.”
* **SPA** → Practical, humid, weather-beaten; cyclone trackers chatter; salt air, hydraulic fluid, ozone from storm sensors.
* **NC** → Peeling **grand-project posters**, procurement dashboards everywhere; optimistic renders beside half-installed hardware—apologetic ambition.
* **GCC** → Fuel/food co-op logos on **date-syrup packets** and PPE; immaculate Earthside depots, thin beyond GEO—presence as riders on others’ assets.
* **Baltic Alliance** → Hazard-model printouts taped to bulkheads; crisp checklists; signage with ECS-adjacent legalese: “By entering, you submit to Register escrow.”

---

### Technology & Interface Feel

* **Glitchy Avatars** → Occasional desyncs; sensitive reviews occur in **Protected Dataset Compartments** (escrowed, view-only), hence abrupt “blink-outs.”
* **Through-Path Classes** → **Red/Amber/Blue** delivery via **leased uplinks**; speed/clarity are contractual, not physical. Red is crisp; Blue arrives batched with visible artifacts.
* **Legacy Errors** → Obscure codes from old stacks (“K-88 Fault”); everyone knows the three-step workaround, nobody knows the root cause.

---

### Economic & Liability Texture

* **Liability Drift** → When responsibility becomes procedurally unclear over time: “The whole sector is in liability drift.”
* **Premium Tiers** → Status by coverage: ship policies and personal riders are social currency.
* **Actuarial Murmur** → Not stocks—risk tables, bond ratings, casualty futures.
* **Cleanup Bonds** → Escrow posted before salvage/high-risk ops; delays are the freighter’s constant complaint.
* **Crew Proverbs** → **“No CNO-C, no pump.”** / **“URW opened.”** (Translation: premiums spike; ops freeze.)

---

### Life on Earth

* **Urban Texture** → Cities fragmented: patchwork languages, factional enclaves, infrastructure stretched thin. Power ration windows; rolling blackouts in poorer zones. Prestige blocs keep **Registered Resilience Complexes**—sealed towers with private water and backup air.
* **Everyday People** → Most follow the alien drama via state-framed feeds. Household math is food/water/energy.
* **Culture** → National holidays repurposed as “audit compliance days.” Lottery-based sports/education in ECS states still leave cultural scars.
* **Transition to Space** →

  * **Spaceport Feel:** Sterile checkpoint, half border crossing, half pre-surgical screening; antiseptic and recycled air.
  * **Liability Waivers:** Public terminal thumb-presses under a flat AI voice: “Liability for systemic failure legally waived.”

---

### Life on Stations

* **Housing** → 3×4 m modular cubicles; partitions reconfigurable. Families rare; unions reserve “hab-blocks” for contract clusters—sterile, temporary.
* **Daily Rhythm** → Earth-day light cycles; noise never stops: recyclers hum, air ducts hiss. Corridor graffiti persists despite scrubbing—part art, part protest.
* **Children & Families** → Rare but present; tied to long-duration contractors/political staff. Kids kept in inner hubs (shielding/air quality). Schooling via overlays + small rotational cells (avatars + 1–2 humans).
* **Social Layer** → Canteens (algae fritters, reconstituted stews, gossip). Bars pipe Earth feeds a few seconds delayed.
* **Governance & Commerce** →

  * **Jurisdictional Seams:** Color-coded deck lines; crossing flips your slate’s **data-privacy defaults** and fine schedule.
  * **Grey Market:** **Manifest fudging** beats hidden compartments; mislabeled cargo passes as paste or pump spares.
  * **Automated Fines:** Small, constant auto-deducts (loitering, water rations, non-approved ports) with a flat admin chime.

---

### Life on Ships

* **Living Quarters** → Bunks stacked with curtains; personal space = a locker and pinboard. No families.
* **Routine** → 6-hour duty blocks, punctuated by **audit-log sessions**; four-person bridge watches; anomalies trigger § reviews and a 15-minute wardroom hot-wash.
* **Atmosphere** → Sealant, sweat, hot plastic; the occasional ping of micrometeoroid impacts.
* **Culture** → Charms above bunks; ritual banter about regs; superstition: **never run a full diagnostic under burn** (manuals lie).
* **Hierarchy** → Officers eat fractionally better (extra protein pack); everyone knows it’s theater.
* **Psych Texture** →

  * **Logorrhea:** Long-haul compulsion to over-document trivialities in personal logs—audit culture side-effect.
  * **Ghost Comms:** Phantom alerts heard in the fan-hum during comms blackouts.
  * **System Superstitions:** Sacred reboot sequences, timing rituals; harmless, until they collide with real procedures.

---

### Children & Families (Stations vs Ships)

* **Stations** → Families tolerated on prestige hubs with **family-rider** premiums; elsewhere discouraged (liability). Children = “luxury ballast.”
* **Ships** → No dependents; protocols forbid it. Crews sometimes “adopt” station kids informally (sponsorships, treats, tutoring on layovers).

---

## Living & Working (drop-in behavior kit)

* **Ground Rules** → *Insurance before physics.* **Custody beats command.** **Through-path rights are rationed.** **Humans are required keys** (M-of-N).
* **Newcomer’s 90-Day Curve** →

  * **Weeks 1–2:** Learn the killers: **coverage gates**, **jurisdiction seams**, **uplink throttles**; pause when **URW** opens.
  * **Weeks 3–4:** Pre-draft filings; keep a benign fallback archive.
  * **Weeks 5–8:** Speak in riders—“**CNO-C pending**,” “**TPS heat-cycle at limit**”; sleep around beam windows.
  * **Weeks 9–12:** Adopt local superstitions (don’t sign during throttle clocks; don’t cross seams on dispute calls).
* **In-Scene Defaults** → Every room has a **coverage ticker**; every corridor a **seam stripe**; every briefing a **rider line-item**; every character one **paper reflex** (the filing they reach for under stress).
