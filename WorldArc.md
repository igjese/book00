# Wold arc for 12-book series

**World arc**  - Hyper-today: similar geopolitical blocks, capitalism + rival systems, same religions (but somewhat avoided in the story), core worries are economy / environment / security. Heavily automated (drones, AI aids), but **AGI never quite arrived.** Everything driven by incentives, logistics, old fears in shiny new suits. 

| **Topic**                 | **Key Points**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI & Automation**       | • No AGI — only countless narrow AIs drafting layered recommendations, almost never executing major decisions by law and culture. <br> • Reliance varies: some regions let their “mesh” plan nearly everything, others enforce heavy human oversight. <br> • Corporations, agencies, and lobbies fund rival expert systems, driving constant clashes over whose “optimal” plan wins. <br> • Most jobs revolve around steering or auditing AIs, even skilled trades supervise drones. <br> • Complex field work stays mixed crews — humans make judgment calls, drones act as hands and eyes. |
| **Computers & Cloud**     | • No one says “computer” — wearables handle local processing, walls or glasses display it, heavy work runs on tiered cloud slices. <br> • Basic cloud/AI access is a civil right but also a subtle control lever; states can throttle or favor usage. <br> • Privacy is stratified: top tiers get armored data vaults, low tiers are so porous they’re nearly public. <br> • Sharing is instant and risky, spawning everyday scams and subtle manipulation.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Digital Currency**      | • Digital e-currencies are universal, but cash still clings on for small local buys; large cash deals trigger audits. <br> • States use currencies to shape behavior — micro taxes, nudges, transaction frictions — mostly accepted unless blatantly rigged. <br> • Small evasions are normal: IOUs, barter, loyalty credits, discreet cash topping. <br> • Privacy and circumvention depend on means; most dodge, adapt, or comply as needed.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Energy & Industry**     | • Modular fission is widespread but uneven; some regions refuse it, stuck on imports or old fuels. <br> • Renewables were overbuilt in panic booms, now costly to maintain with odd local price spikes and blackout risks. <br> • Oil & hydrogen still power heavy transport and industry, their networks remain geopolitical fault lines. <br> • Fusion is flashy but non-viable — prestige demos feed speculation, not grids. <br> • Grid reliability varies wildly: some cities run stable microgrids, others face brownouts, fuel mafias, and hidden insurance costs.                    |
| **Climate & Environment** | • Earth’s glacial cycles lurk behind forecasts; even a modest cooling could drop seas, dry interiors, and strain economies long before true ice ages. <br> • Policies stay contradictory: seawalls and carbon capture boom alongside new fossil pushes, each side cherry-picks models. <br> • Local responses follow incentives: rich coastlines fund defenses, inland zones chase drought tweaks, unstable states sell out for quick gains. <br> • Cultures fracture: urban youth push degrowth, elites build tech buffers, rural areas stick to tradition until collapse forces change.    |
| **CRISPR & Biotech** | • Mild edits are routine — fixing birth defects, small immunity boosts — seen as normal medicine. <br> • Anything beyond that is taboo, heavily restricted, and widely believed to be technically out of reach. <br> • Still, persistent rumors swirl about smarter or stronger engineered elites, though evidence is murky and often dismissed as conspiracy or status envy. <br> • Most people feel a mix of unease and fascination, treating deep edits as half-myth, half-threat. |
| **Population & Labor** | • Global population has peaked and begun to decline, aging across most regions with fewer young workers. <br> • Many simple or repetitive roles have vanished under automation, replaced by hybrid oversight or niche service work. <br> • People still work long careers — often into their 80s — with subtle social or economic penalties for stepping out, even if raw survival needs less labor. <br> • Partial basics and local supports soften desperation but don’t erase it; reputation and small economic perks drive most to stay active. <br> • Different cultures fill the gap variously: local co-ops, prestige projects, subtle status competitions, or low-key decadence. |
| **Wealth & Inequality** | • Tech and finance have widened gaps: the rich buy better biotweaks, deeper cloud contracts, and somewhat longer vitality — while ordinary people patch together modest upgrades or partial protections. <br> • Mega-corporations are larger and more powerful than today, but still operate within the push and pull of major states — cutting deals, paying fines, shaping policy rather than outright replacing governments. <br> • Power is transactional and layered through bureaucracies and influence webs, not overt oligarch rule. <br> • Status still rests on competence, reputation, and communication — but elite circles play on easier mode with stacked advantages. |
| **Space & Naval** | • Launch costs have dropped through relentless optimization, making small crewed ships and cargo runs viable — but still rare and massively insured. <br> • Used for zero-g manufacturing, asteroid extraction, and fragile patrol navies that exist more to reassure investors and regulators than fight wars. <br> • Each ship loss or major accident shakes markets and politics, with insurance and risk derivatives playing outsized roles. <br> • Legal and regulatory chaos is constant: disputes over inspections, taxes, labor rights, and sabotage keep fleets tied up in courts as much as in orbit. |
| **Culture & Daily Life** | • Many people rely on deeply personalized AI companions — part assistant, therapist, confidant, and subtle manipulator — filling social, emotional, and organizational gaps without judgment. <br> • Status games and small ideological hobby wars still dominate social life, now filtered through these AI lenses that learn personal biases and reinforce them. <br> • Young people often struggle to find stable starts, drifting between patchy gigs, reputation plays, or informal local economies. <br> • Regional cultures adapt differently: some double down on high-tech immersion and companion culture, others flaunt low-tech or human-only lifestyles as status rebellion. <br> • Underneath it all, the same human drives persist: fear, pride, petty grievances — just channeled through slick new interfaces. |
| **Generational Cycles** | • The world is still run by older leaders who built or managed massive climate and energy projects decades ago — proud of stabilizing society, clinging to those old narratives of success. <br> • Their children, now middle-aged, grew up under big programs and social campaigns, raised to keep systems running smoothly and avoid major risks — cautious, process-focused, trying to perfect what exists. <br> • Young adults are more skeptical and practical, shaped by seeing bloated systems, patchy failures, and quiet corruption; they value competence, shortcuts, and personal networks over big slogans. <br> • Teenagers and kids, growing up just as alien hints start surfacing, will inherit a different world — likely pushing for more collective or ambitious projects in reaction to their parents’ wary pragmatism, if crises deepen. |

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tech & Society Defaults**      | Generic “cyberpunk-lite” overlays, status games, long-lived bored masses, retro youth, interchangeable with countless dystopias. | Keep overlays but make them **fragile, often glitchy, or locally banned**; show people using them for petty, irrational reasons (status envy, local politics).             |
| **AI & Automation**              | Expert systems run everything while humans decay or scheme, no tension or surprise.                                              | Invert: **AIs can’t execute — only recommend at lightning speed, humans must sign off**. So incompetent people bottleneck brilliant systems.                               |
| **Space = Age of Sail**          | Pirates, insurance & legal chaos replaying merchant marine tropes.                                                               | Twist: **“Pirates” are lawyers, insurers, or micro-state navies exploiting loopholes & paperwork seizures.** Actual shipboard mutiny is rare & shocking.                   |
| **Black Markets & Surveillance** | Neon contraband scenes & shallow hackers as standard rebellion.                                                                  | Make it **gray-market by default — like socialist barter: everyone trades off books, apps, meds.** No slick rebels, just ordinary hustle.                                  |
| **Climate Flip-Flop**            | Simple overheat → ice age toggle echoing old eco collapse stories.                                                               | Keep cycles but highlight **chaotic local policies, rival geoengineering cults, or regional denial movements** that make global strategy impossible.                       |
| **Decadent Longevity**           | Old rich vs decaying basics, classic transhuman divide.                                                                          | Narrow the tech: **rich live longer but not prettier — more decrepit, with support pods, afraid to be offline.** No graceful immortality.                                  |
| **Emotional Shortcuts**          | Tragic ship losses or quick betrayals for easy drama; cautious underdog survives as moral lesson.                                | Keep harsh events but show them as **logistics-driven accidents or slow-simmer schemes, not convenient gut-punchs.** And your hero’s survival is boring grind, not virtue. |
| **Generational Loops**           | Cycles of builders → decadents → panickers as mere costume swaps.                                                                | Sharpen by showing **local exceptions:** pockets stuck two turns back, microcultures refusing the swing, some never get decadent at all.                                   |
| **Tech as Hidden Utopia**        | Overlays & implants patching all cracks, making it subtly utopian.                                                               | Explicitly show **overlays break down under stress, implants are regulated by fragile supply chains, most can’t afford serious mods.**                                     |
| **Stock Scenes & Symbols**       | VR-addled neon youths, big insurance tickers, pilots with family photos, shallow body mods.                                      | Replace with **old men tracking insurance markets on paper ledgers, family photos as local altars, mods as functional desperation (arthritis relief)**.                    |
| **Shallow AI Naming**            | “Mesh,” “agents,” etc. without exploring how people misuse or resent them.                                                       | Drill into how **locals curse or personify systems — “the mesh robbed me,” “my agents backstabbed me” — showing distrust & irrational blame.**                             |
