| **Humans never change**                                                                 | Same fears, pride, petty grievances, from caves to orbital habitats.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Utopias don’t exist**                                                                 | Because human incentives & flaws grind them down. Attempts to enforce them often breed soft or hard tyranny.                                                                                                                                              |
| **People are brutal if unchecked**                                                      | Survival instincts are primal. Humanity is apex predator for a reason. Both individuals and groups have a “kill switch.”                                                                                                                                  |
| **Everyone is self-interested, but irrationally so**                                    | People build personal worldviews mainly to justify shortcomings, so often act against real interests while feeling they’re defending them.                                                                                                                |
| **Most people stop evolving surprisingly early**                                        | They keep doing what worked once, decades past relevance. Looks absurd to outsiders, but it’s normal.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **History, tech, culture aren’t linear**                                                | Not a march of progress. Roman engineers or scribes were the same minds in different tech contexts.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Politics run in cycles**                                                              | Cycles between populist waves (emotional, promising simple solutions, often scapegoating) and hard-liner phases (rigid, technocratic or authoritarian corrections). Each is a reaction to the excesses of the last.                                       |
| **Generations run in cycles**                                                           | Often roughly four phases: idealistic builders, comfortable consolidators, cynical dismantlers, fearful restorers. The “Fourth Turning” captures part of this — you’re skeptical of its “inevitable cataclysm,” but the generational pendulum rings true. |
| **Most people act shocked by cycles**                                                   | Despite them being natural and repeated through history, people believe each phase is permanent.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Everyone ultimately lives off competence, reputation, communication**                 | Strip systems down, and survival or success depends on these three.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Tarot & I Ching matter because they give you signals from yourself**                  | They act as external mirrors — often more objective than “you,” who is clouded by being inside the problem. They pull up how your subconscious thinks things will work out if you handle it in the same way you usually do.                               |
| **Most underestimate incentives, overestimate utopias**                                 | Leads to repeated disappointments and doomed grand schemes.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Soft censorship is most effective**                                                   | Social norms and fears shape speech and thought long before formal repression is needed.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Challenging narratives brings punishment**                                            | Disagreement makes you a target, quickly cast as the enemy. Timeless.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **True beliefs leak via sarcasm, micro-signals**                                        | Real agreement or dissent only surfaces where there’s trust, often signaled in jokes or subtle cues.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Best improvisers are also meticulous planners**                                       | They value planning not for rigid execution, but to prepare the mind for rapid adjustment.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Plans always break; reality demands improv**                                          | Systems that “fail fast” are better — they reveal faults early. Same for stories & characters.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Systems become self-preserving**                                                      | Bureaucracies, institutions, even ideas develop instincts to survive beyond their usefulness.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Big systems self-balance, but with wild swings**                                      | Not stable; dynamic churn that finds temporary equilibriums.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Tech doesn’t fix human flaws**                                                        | Greed, fear, status games remain, only with shinier tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Short-term thinking dominates**                                                       | Most chase immediate gains, undermining future stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Maintenance matters more than fireworks**                                             | Real power is in quietly keeping things running, not grand launches.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **People over-rely on tools, especially mediocre individuals**                          | They believe the tool will do the work for them, avoid learning fundamentals, then are shocked when it fails. The tool reflects their incompetence, not replaces it.                                                                                      |
| **Positioning often matters more than execution**                                       | Being in the right spot, or setting up the right angles, trumps perfect plans or flawless implementation. Many who win simply stood where the opportunity passed.                                                                                         |
| **Most people avoid taking responsibility for their circumstances**                     | It’s more comforting to blame fate, politics, the past, or “the system.” Owning up would require hard self-reckoning.                                                                                                                                     |
| **That’s why role models, religions, movements are so popular**                         | They let people outsource responsibility: “I’m just following this higher authority,” or “it’s not my fault if this fails, it’s what we all do.”                                                                                                          |
| **Most people are sheep, some are dogs**                                                | The majority follow social norms or herds. A smaller subset organizes, polices, manages — like shepherd dogs.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Some fraction of each are predators**                                                 | A natural minority in both groups are almost sociopathic — seeing others purely as resources, obstacles, or toys. They thrive because most sheep & dogs can’t fathom such unfiltered self-interest.                                                       |
| **Most people never truly learn money, communication, relationships, or the other sex** | Even though these are arguably the most important knowledge areas for everything in life. Most stumble through on default scripts, half-understood instincts, or cultural clichés — and are shocked by the consequences.                                  |
| **Nobody is evil. Everyone is right in some way.**                                      | Nobody (bare psychopats) wokes up as a villain. Conflict arises when two opposing parties are both acting on otherwise perfectly normal, mundane and legitimate needs and incentives.                                                                     |
