# Main Story Timeline

first there is an object at the bottom of enceladus ocean. at first we are not sure, but it seems something is there. huge funds would be needed even to check, with key people and governments having widely different reactions and beliefs about it. 

when it's finally confirmed, some still don't trust it. also even bigger funding is needed to sample it or anything. urgency creeps in but only to some, basically scaled up version of the prior dilemmas.

unexpected makeshift aliance finally sample it, with political chaos breaking up (not violent but tense nevertheless), but soon most get disinterested when they realize it is half-fossilized i.e. many thousands of years old.

there is a backlash because of huge funds spent (by almost everyone) for questionable or at least not immediately useful results, that answer almost no question but raise more and more.

next step is to investigate the object. what it is? how old it is? where it came from? who made it?

each of these question needs more funding and serious commitment, but there is no will (with some exceptions) to go extra mile any more. years pass with mostly token teams coming up with clever new ways to test many angles of this mystery with shoe-string (not really, but compared to initial push) budget

they need to do thorough geological-history survey of Enceladus to come up with ways of carbon-dating equivalents of the site, the bedrock, the mud, etc. no one wants to spend that kind of money, but no-one can be seen to do nothing either - most powers come up with token excuses for a mission just to be able to say they are following up

they also start looking in 1000x more detail at signals from all the near stars (within 50ly), cataloguing anything that even remotely could be argued as artificial. new disciplines emerge, coming up with as vastly different as possible "alien ways" to communicate from linguistic to technological

another branch of research is how to find hints where it came from - luck would certainly be needed whatever they try, and funding of course. at what angle it smashed at the bottom? what were the precise conditions then? were there any explosions in the very thin atmosphere? any way to detect them many millenia later? does it even make any sense to try to find out if there might be a vessel under it's own power and navigation (so any "angle of entry" might not mean anything)?

Insurance shifts first, because they hate uncertainty. That single tweak cascades. New carve-outs ripple through space contracts, bumping premiums, tightening credit. A few small contractors fold. Bigger players start demanding ironclad inspections and reserve funds, quietly reshaping who can even afford to be in orbit.

Meanwhile, the money already spent doesn’t just vanish. 

All those super-cooled spectrometers, stress-proof alloys, long-haul drone tugs? Turns out they are fantastic for high precision zero-g manufacturing. Within a decade, cheap knockoff lines start pumping out ultra-stable quantum processors, fracture-proof glass composites, and field diagnostic labs that can run a hundred tests on a drop of blood. All of it just human desperation to justify budgets. Few big players start building permanent footholds in orbital corridors to defend these new cash flows, and quietly erase the embarrassment of all those wasted mission cycles.

Stations meant to host long-duration Enceladus monitoring arrays pivot into bonded freeports, then into secure data havens and orbital arbitration courts.
Patrols become a norm, to keep shipping steady and tax flows predictable.
No one wants surprises near assets they’ve already half-paid off — so fragile new alliances form, purely to keep traffic and finances moving.

Governments maneuver to place “liaison staff” there, corporations lobby to rewrite port quotas, even mid-tier powers start buying patrol slots just to guarantee a say when someone defaults or files a salvage claim.

And all the while incentives start piling up again. Regulators, insurers, manufacturers — each with skin in the game now — begin quietly lobbying to keep the “alien monitoring initiatives” alive, with real goal to protect the ecosystems spun up around them.

Orbital economies mature enough, and they’re there, with infrastructure, contractors, and idle orbital support capacity that would otherwise go to waste. 

A few mid-tier coalitions (like blocs of coastal or resource-strapped nations) see an opportunity to claw back relevance. They pitch a “New Enceladus Initiative” not out of curiosity, but to set trade policy, secure long-term orbital leases, and get first dibs on spinoff patents (since they missed out the first wave). They pool resources for a big campaign, ironically outspending what the superpowers are willing to risk directly.

After years of gouging premiums, the risk models ironically start seeing less variance — too many contracts tangled up, too many assets dependent on stable Saturn operations. Underwriters offer lower premiums for operators who participate in “certified alien hazard mapping,” to limit future liability.

After a glut of smaller exploratory or microfabrication booms, thousands of specialized techs and orbital contractors need new big-ticket work. Labor unions and local politicians quietly lobby to launch a comprehensive survey, just to keep systems warm and workers employed.

Over years, better low-orbit scanning arrays, smarter subsurface drones, and more sensitive isotope labs have incrementally chipped away at unknowns. It becomes arguably cheaper to do one grand integrated mission than keep running myryad of tiny redundant tests. The big push is basically a budget consolidation play, ironically pitched as “cost reduction.”

So after decades of drift, the same small surveys finally get folded into a “big unified survey mission,” mostly pitched as a cost savings to keep contractors busy and trade lanes insured.

Big push comes, everything already being done for decades is scaled up immensely. Preparation takes years - again, and the series of missions another years. Turns out that’s enough scale to actually move the needle.

They nail down it was almost certainly a probe — internal compartments, tight-beam radiation scarring, no organic residue. Models sharpen just enough to back-trace a broad entry cone, roughly toward a loose cluster of near stars. Wider than anyone wants, but no longer infinite.


most sensor arrays are locked in on that star group. signals are identified that just might be artificial (out of million candidate signals, but now analyzed with arrays of quantum computers, which were not available back then).

exo-planet surveys are also locked on that group. planets are somewhat catalogued, but existing tech is not good enough - creates more speculation than answers.

everything becomes big disappointment again. huge funds sunk, with nothing to really show for it - except rich becoming richer, again. cycle repeats: no-one can afford to jump out, but everyone is happiest with lot of words but just almost-token teams left to churn it out on shoe string budgets.

alternate-life-avenues come again into the focus, exploring possibilities of life with alternatives to carbon chains, ATP based energy, water as universal solvent - what exact circumstances would be needed for any of those. and of course trying to map new theories and findings to possible planets identified in the cluster

there are false breakthroughs. groups intentionally contaminate the data to corner the market. occassional deep-fakes are made to serve some immediate political purpose (which also happened in previous cycles)

then decades of new industry and sciences maturing to isolate that most promising signals all come from the same planet. the surprise is that it's not an earth-sister in goldy-lock zone, so it takes a long time for consensus to accept the findings as plausible or even probable.

the acceptance that these possible neighbors are almost certainly vastly different than us in everything comes as a deep shock, that reverberates trough everything: sciences, religions, cultures, you name it.

another conflict is whether we try to signal them? it would take 43 years for signal to get there, one way. and it proves not so easy anyway, as naively thought decades ago (now we know much more about the challenges because we spent decades trying to identify THEIR signals). any meaningful probe would take thousands of years with current tech to get there, few centuries if theoretically (not a real option) the whole planet scrambled to improve experimental techs that just might make it possible, and only with luck and decades of preparation on unprecedented scale.

it seems prudent to ignore them until we are much more advanced, while building at least some defences and ideas how to scale them quickly if ever needed. vast arrays monitoring that part of the sky are a given, now not searching for signals, but for drive signatures or any suspicious anomaly.

maybe we then try putting a relay on their other side, to try to communicate that way, but it is even more far away, and also risky, just less so. contingencies start being planned, but without real intent to implement them, just to make public feel safe.

and a security implications are enormous - they have probably been more advanced than us, probably still are. suddenly it's not a theoretical problem, but possibly life or death issue, maybe even on extinction-scale. it's even easier to be nervous since their biology must be vastly different than ours - they are definitely not our cosmic brothers and sisters.

tensions and political clashes arise over ideas of jurisdiction and enforcement over "contact matters", some posturing and some real.

increasing number of fringe groups try to send a signal, clamping down on first few by any of the big powers cascaded into series of crisis and ever more unstable geopolitics

then one of these groups managed to secretly launch a probe, from outer system. realistically chances for it not to be discovered were nill, with all the sensors looking at that direction, but their idea was it would be already too far away to do anything about it.

this bring shocking unity (kind of, not real unity but common understanding) in response from major powers. there is no time to waste, since each week passed will require exponentially costlier response. 

big powers throw in everything they have, no holds barred, and in 15 months first earth's long-range ship is racing after the probe. the risk is relatively small but still unacceptable to leave it to autonomous AI.

political consequences are huge, but now the knives are already out. major dissident groups and factions are mercilessly crushed. UN vehemently objects but is marginalized and almost dismantled, in the end left purely as administrative body for run-of-the-mill operations, and only advising body (just to keep appearances) for new and now de-facto ruling body the "Ruling Council" - uneasy and not very stable agreement between big powers, where nobody wants to really be there with all the headaches but they cannot afford not to. 

RC mandate is not clear, their jurisdiction is not clear, their future is not clear, but their purpose is to ruthlessly enforce what are at least for the moment clear priorities of not letting anyone except the members (and only when all agree, but it already looks only theoretical) do or decide anything about contacting the aliens. Right from the start they seem corrupt and members misuse the new-found enforcement unity to "permantently solve" at least those few "problems" they agree on enough to be able to make a deal.

Waves of hype → moral panic → boredom → repeat**                                               | **Cycle fractures into asynchronous local patterns:**<br><br>• **Region A:** A proud coastal trade bloc blew billions on early missions, *never recovers.* Now it *pretends the mystery is settled,* pushes school curricula calling it a “minor historical curiosity,” violently censors new hype to avoid political embarrassment.<br><br>• **Region B:** A resource-poor coalition that lucked into early contracts stays *permanently on edge.* Their entire insurance + heavy industry base relies on “alien risk pricing,” so any lull terrifies them — they actively push for constant ‘risk mapping campaigns’ to keep the machine fed.<br><br>• **Region C:** A mid-tier superpower with fragile culture, after an early moral panic, locks everything under *quasi-religious secrecy.* Only priest-scientists can handle real data; for everyone else it’s symbolic pageants, no raw evidence. |
| **2. Insurance & underwriters become the main political force shaping orbitals, navies, and trade** | **Starts with the *opposite:*** local cults, prestige patrons, and micro-states fund small exploratory missions out of pride or faith, launching fragile micro-drones into deep space.<br><br>This chaotic patchwork quickly collapses under technical failures, duplicated efforts, and unmanageable liability. Big powers quietly discourage them, seeing them as adding noise and risk.<br><br>That’s when insurance cartels step in — pooling colossal resources to stabilize large-scale operations, effectively taking over. But to keep premiums and markets from chaos, they begin suppressing or faking risk data, paying off audit crews, sometimes letting records “accidentally disappear,” ironically making future dangers worse.    |
| **“Stations pivot from alien observation hubs into freeports, data havens, arbitration courts.”** | - **Some stations fail outright,** abandoned half-built or cannibalized for materials, left as slowly decaying orbital wrecks — *salvage drones pick through them, but insurers blacklist them entirely.*<br><br>• **Some become enforced quarantine chokepoints,** mandated by insurance pools: *any vessel with flagged sensor anomalies must dock, undergo forced diagnostics or even partial disassembly.* These turn sterile, bureaucratic, dread-heavy.<br><br>• **Some get locked down as ultra-high-security labs or thinly veiled military outposts,** used by major powers to keep alien-adjacent research contained under direct guns and no-fly corridors.<br><br>• **Some *do* evolve into freeports or arbitration zones — but not neon cyberpunk havens.** They’re messy, regional trade hubs with crooked paperwork, overlapping legal claims, tired long-haul crews trying to keep contracts stable. Less noir, more *mundane sprawl with petty local rules.* |
| **“Rogue probe forces unity under a new semi-global Ruling Council (which becomes corrupt and self-serving).”** | Huge powers all realize they must act *right now* — not only over the rogue probe, but over the entire chain of escalating alien-adjacent risks. But they are completely aware they cannot agree on almost anything beyond that fact.<br><br>So they create a unique supervisory structure: *each sends one top political operator and one top military officer* to oversee — but they hand day-to-day control to brutally competent crisis directors and technical executives, often ex-military logisticians or insurance catastrophe managers.<br><br>It is narrowly chartered: enforcement is *swift, ruthless, and completely non-negotiable* on the few items they all agree to. Each state watches hawk-like for cheating elsewhere, but ironically this means when the Council acts within its narrow remit, it acts faster and more brutally than any normal international body ever could — because no one can afford to show weakness or risk the alien problem exploding. |
| **“Decades pass, then finally huge unified mission justified by ‘cost savings.’”** | It never lines up naturally. Only after a major mid-tier coalition faces economic meltdown — with fleets and orbital contractors idle, risk of cascading bankruptcies, unions threatening strikes — do they ram through a giant “integrated survey mission” under the guise of *cost efficiency.* In truth, it’s a massive bailout, awkwardly spun as prudent consolidation. The mission happens not from clarity or unity, but from local desperation. |
| **“False breakthroughs, faked data, then eventual partial signals from a broad star cluster spark renewed hype.”** | There are always some ambiguous candidate signals — faint patterns, odd statistical clusters — but fundamentally beyond current human tech and theory to truly decode. This low-level ambiguity *never goes away.* Meanwhile, insurance pools and orbital trade lobbies quietly pay to hype these uncertain signals, selectively fund papers and conferences, because ambiguity props up their contracts and justifies endless “alien risk certification” regimes. Real science drags on in the background, while market-driven illusions shape most policy. |
| **“Realization they’re not our cosmic brothers triggers deep psychological & cultural shock.”** | Instead of panic, humans mostly co-opt the alien difference for petty uses. Biotech giants pivot to developing *specialized microbial or plant chains inspired by possible alien pathways* — not to change humans or terraform entire worlds, but to build **extreme condition industrial tools**: microbes that process heavy brines in deep mines, polymer-secreting bacteria for ultra-cold drilling, hyper-selective filtration membranes for orbital recycling. |
| **“Fringe groups try to signal or launch probes, get crushed by major powers, leading to tighter global enforcement.”** | Over the first decades, countless fringe groups, cult alliances, and rogue regional coalitions keep trying to send signals or launch micro-probes — often using crowdfunding, shady off-books contractors, or repurposed industrial tugs.<br><br>Early crackdowns are *fragmented and opportunistic:* handled by whichever major or mid-tier power feels threatened, needs a distraction, or simply sees a cheap chance to flex. Some fringe efforts get crushed brutally as warnings, others are ignored if deemed too minor.<br><br>Adding to the mess: *big powers quietly fund or manipulate some of these fringe launches themselves,* using cut-outs or covert proxies — to test each other’s detection systems, measure insurance ripple effects, or see if the alien problem can be stirred without direct fingerprints. |
