# Book 1 - Translated (outdated)

## Chapter 1

Relay 6A drifted in its Lagrange anchor. Still powered and pressurized. But no one paid attention anymore.

It was built during the treaty expansion push, when outer-system supply lanes were sprouting faster than anyone could regulate. It moved priority transfers and inspection loads for shared patrols. Anything with a treaty tag came through here. Now, it pushed second-tier cargo toward patrol routes no one checked. Nothing flagged urgent or worth redirecting.

L5 had made sense at the time — close enough to share thrust windows, far enough to avoid jurisdiction overlap. Then the route maps changed. Transfer corridors shifted spinward, faster and cheaper. Relay 6A was left behind, running now on bloc subsidies and third-tier contractor bids no one wanted to audit.

Hero was already at Dock B, scanning the manifest again. The prep was already done — AI work, not human. But someone was still required to sign it off.

Four pallets. Quantum lensing arrays, precision etched, cryo-rated. Clean calibration tags, stable casings, everything high-grade. Nothing he’d expect to see routed through here.

Destination: Enceladus orbit. No payload brief. Just coordinates, designation codes, and a routing flag that hadn’t been touched since initial approval.

The station AI had already filled out most of the chain — supplier manifests, tag hashes, transit permissions, preclearance stubs. All of it stacked, labeled, and queued, ready to commit.

Yet, he checked it anyway. Line by line.

He logged one copy for internal reference, one for backup, and a third for cross-signature — in case the auditors ever pulled a block scan. He tagged them red, blue, yellow without thinking.

Named the files:
audit_final_internal
audit_final_backup
audit_final_crosssig

They synced to his slate. The light blinked twice — once for local, once for cloud. He ran a hash check, scanned the sync log, and compared the overlay results. Careful work should still mean something.

A soft tone.

“You’ve made duplicate entries,” the station AI said. “You know this slows things down.”

Hero tapped the override.

“Duplicates retained,” it confirmed. Then again, quieter: “Again.”

He closed the overlay and looked across the bay. Two drones hovered over the cryo-pallets, motionless except for a quiet gyro correction every few seconds. They didn’t exactly idle, just waited.

“Still triple-checking?” a voice asked.

A dock tech — mid-shift — wandered up holding a foil meal chit between two fingers, dangling it like a treat.

Hero didn’t look. “Expired.”

She pocketed it again. “You always this allergic to shortcuts?”

“That’s what the contract pays for.”

She gave a crooked smile and walked off. Her boots made a dull clack against the deck plates — not loud, just deliberate.

Hero turned back. The terminal had flagged a new prompt.

“Purpose field: left blank.”

The arrays weren’t marked for standard orbital installs. No filter masks, no thermal overlays. Nothing military. Not broadcast, not mapping. The tags didn’t say much, but that was probably the point. Probably scanwork, or something related.

He didn’t enter anything.

“Let’s pretend the stars know” he muttered, not quite to himself.

No one responded. One drone shifted left a few degrees and rebalanced.

On the wall, a once-shiny plaque had come unstuck at one edge. It was tilting just slightly off the bulkhead, with stenciled lettering somewhat faded but legible:

TREATY LOGISTICS OVERRIDE — PRIORITY CHANNEL (DEFUNCT)

No one had bothered to take it down. They’d just stopped updating the protocol behind it.

Hero paced the length of the wall. Slow, even steps, just enough to loosen the tension in his legs. His thumb drifted across the seam of his uniform as he moved, without thought.

The extra copies weren’t required. No one wanted them.

But they were on record. Something he could point to if anyone ever asked.

Redundancy was easy. It didn’t argue.

## Chapter 2

The message came mid-shift.

“Cargo 7C–gamma: seal containment flagged. Quarantine initiated. Claim evaluation pending.”
Just a system alert — probably dockside. Preformatted.

He paused. That wasn’t routine.

Thirty seconds later, another ping — his employer’s office, no subject line.
“One of your pallets just flagged red. Do you know anything about it?”

He didn’t. But he was already walking there.

By the time he reached the corridor, the quarantine curtain was already up.

The sealant fog hadn’t cleared yet. It hung low, just enough to sting through the filtered air. Three pallets stood iced over. One had cracked along the edge — uneven, brittle, like the pressure dropped mid-transfer.

Two insurer drones hovered above the crates. They weren’t scanning anymore. Just holding position, displaying intent glyphs — crude, color-coded, and slow. Required policy, in case a human was watching.

The glyphs kept flipping, never settling. Disagreement — Hero had seen it before.

Both drones were building their own chain of events. The versions didn’t match, so nothing moved forward.

Behind the glass, two maintenance staff stood still. No urgency, gloves off. Just watching.

Hero stepped into the sealed alcove. His badge pinged — his entrance is being logged. He put his glasses on, permissions flickered and the overlay synced.

“Containment response complete,” the station AI announced for protocol. “Triage active. Damage logged across contract clusters C4, E7, and F–neutral. Review pending.”

He didn’t reply. Just stepped toward the wall display — old-style manifest board. Basic info only. The overlay filled in the rest.

Chirps echoed through the fog — sync pulses from the insurer drones, not station rhythm.

The drones hovered above the wreckage. Not station models. He didn’t recognize the tags or the overlay hierarchy. 

Not local. Possibly leased, almost certainly uncooperative.

The overlay caught up as he focused on the central panel.

Its header said:
- Subject: Sealbreach - Dock B, pallet section 7C
- Access Level: Edits not allowed. Submit any request to Relay 6B
- Cert Status: Temporary voided. Override lock active.

The certificate chain was already voided. That meant the drones had escalated.

At least the station’s version made it clear: no sabotage, no fraud. Just the usual kind of failure.

One AI had routed based on predicted transit curves. Another lagged thermal drift flags by forty-six minutes. Both valid on their own, but legally incompatible. 

He opened the cross-signature log — just to check.

His entry was still there: audit_final_crosssig.xlog.
Last modified: him.

Everything after it had triggered conflicts — wrong order, mismatched flags, unverifiable tags.

The overlay updated:
— Conflicting entries invalidated
— Previous entries marked for manual review
— Timestamps unreliable
— Certificate chain incomplete
— Tier-3 verification pending

So his cert was the only one still holding the audit chain together. Even if the chain was incomplete.

His cert hadn’t been accepted either. Just not rejected.

He stared at the prompt, then closed it.

One drone stopped sending updates.

An avatar faded in on the wall display — insurer standard: generic suit, no insignia. Neutral stance, but somehow radiating trust. The kind everyone licensed from the same vendor.

“We’re holding the chain at the last tentatively valid certificate. Regulatory systems can’t proceed until the conflict is resolved — including review of all flagged entries and confirmation of timestamp integrity. Review is already underway. All parties with registered stake will receive updates as synchronization proceeds.”

Hero didn’t respond. His cert stayed pinned. But that didn’t mean he was safe.

The avatar turned slightly — not toward him, but toward the display. The audit file was still open.

## Chapter 3

The message came in early evening. Standard compliance header — minimal fields, no flags. Just enough to log it - and maybe avoid tripping auto-escalation:

Subject: Compliance Review Attendance
Time: 08:30 station time
Location: Office B-112, Logistics & Certification
Registered presence expected. Standard participation protocol applies.

No explanation. But after this morning’s breach, he didn’t need one.

He stayed late. Scanned his backup logs, to make absolutely sure none of it could come back on him. Verified hashes. Checked sync. Cross-checked linked manifests. Flagged every entry with his name on it, just to be sure. Opened audit_final_crosssig.xlog twice, then once more in a clean overlay, trying to see it fresh.

Same checksum. Same header.

By the time he shut down, his food tray had gone cold — a rehydratable meal that actually tasted fine, if you ignored the bland texture.

* * *

The next morning, Office B-112 was already busy.

Tucked at the edge of Compliance, it had once been used for intake briefings. The air still smelled faintly of polymer sealant. Along the far wall, three display panels ran stitched overlays — regulatory bundles from different blocs, not quite formatted the same. No one had ever installed a unifier — it probably didn’t fit compliance budgets. The chairs didn’t match. Two were marked in faded stencil: NAVAL CERTIFICATION – STATION USE ONLY. Nobody was sitting in them.

Hero stepped inside quietly. A few heads turned, then turned back. No one said anything. That wasn’t unusual. 

He scanned the room. Three compliance avatars filled the display panels — one per bloc. Two navy clerks stood back near the wall. An insurer observer leaned by the second panel, arms crossed. Caffeine vapor hissed from a wall unit. One cup sat cooling, untouched.

The avatars were proxy agents — not fully autonomous, but licensed to argue clause precedence and propose provisional findings. Final recommendations would go upstream to off-site legal nodes.

One avatar pressed forward, tone clipped but formal:

“Clause 7 remains applicable — log rollback is pending, not resolved.”

A second followed, more neutral:

“In absence of verified timestamps, the active cert on file remains the only entry currently holding legal position.”

Hero glanced around again. Navy was here — one clerk, silent, observing. Insurer too. But neither contractor had sent anyone. Not even an avatar. That didn’t always mean anything.

But it didn’t help his mood.

He stepped toward the side display. Zoomed in with his overlay.

There it was — audit_final_crosssig.xlog.

This was the file they were all pointing at.

His signature hash sat in the top-right corner, same as before. But now there was a second field highlighted beneath it:

Timestamp: Verified – External sync confirmed (Cloud Register Authority)

That was new. 

Hero blinked once. They’d pulled from his backup — probably sometime after the breach. No one had asked. Probably auto-pulled under evidence retention cause.

He scrolled upward and checked what had changed. The summary panel now listed a fresh cluster of invalidated entries.

He opened the flag on one. It was from the same contractor already caught in the conflict.
All its certs were now disqualified — not valid for this incident. The review cited a  timestamp inconsistency confirmed during recovery. Recommendation: independent audit and legal review.

He checked the rest. Same result. Every cert from both contractors — stripped from the audit chain. Normally that’d take maybe even weeks. Either someone pushed it… or the system just wanted it done.

One avatar shifted its posture — not toward him, but toward the display he was already reading.

“This entry is currently the full chain. Without it, payout routing becomes determinable only through full legal arbitration.”

Another, cooler-toned, followed a moment later:

“Shall we enter a provisional consensus for routing deferral?”

No one replied. The suggestion hung there — logged, but not accepted.

The insurer rep spoke next — softer, but direct:

“These units were tagged for twelve percent reserve clawback. If the audit stalls, eligibility drops.”

Hero didn’t speak. He scrolled the file again.

No edits. No motion. But that didn’t mean it was showing the full picture.

A third avatar — silent until now — spoke at him with procedural calm:

“Please note that direct confirmation needs to be requested but is not required. Do you acknowledge this record as submitted and final, with no subsequent revision?”

He looked once more at the hash. His own, still intact.

“Confirmed,” he said quietly.

A soft chime marked the confirmation. Logged.

That was it. On record. He stood still, for the first time all morning.

It wasn’t serious yet. But definitely not just cleanup anymore.

## Chapter 4

Two days passed with only fragments of updates and legal keep-alives.

The timestamp re-establishing was still flagged “pending.” Arbitration markers moved around the registry. Insurer penalty clocks kept triggering low-priority alerts.

Hero hadn’t touched the audit file since confirming it — but he’d checked it. Twice. Just to make sure it was still there.

He was mid-check on a routine paperwork batch when the message came through — Navy liaison AI, even more terse than usual:

“Your services are requested in Bay 4C. Please comply at your earliest convenience. Do confirm expected arrival.”

He had done contract work for the Navy before — manifests, surplus audits, cargo certifications. But this wasn’t routine. Not even close.

Still, he replied: seven minutes.

Then he quickly finished the file he’d been reviewing. Just a few checksums left. He couldn’t bring himself to leave it half-assed.

He reached Bay 4C just as someone inside was swearing.

Not loudly. Not unprofessionally. But enough to be heard through the open hatch.

Inside, the room looked halfway repurposed — maybe once a vacsuit inspection bay. The hazard signage hadn’t been scrubbed. A folding screen half-obscured the loading schematic. One corner still held a tether ring and floor stencil that read: STAND CLEAR DURING PRESSURE CYCLE.

Three people were arguing near the center console. Navy logistics officer. Insurer representative. And a second Navy clerk — younger, already quiet. A wall-mounted compliance terminal pulsed red between them, linked to an AI probably.

“Custodial status unresolved,” it read. “Cert transfer requires chain resolution. Routing suspended.”

No one turned when Hero stepped in. They’d clearly been stuck for a while.

He cleared his throat. The logistics officer glanced over.

“You’re Hero?”

He nodded. She stepped back without introducing herself.

“Your fallback cert’s still anchoring the old chain. Quorum nodes are still in arbitration - no super-majority to open escrow. We initiated cargo movement two hours ago. Routing failed mid-sequence.”

The insurer added, arms crossed: “New chain can’t initiate while the previous one’s open. No declared closure, no declared custodian.”

“Fallback’s active,” the Navy clerk confirmed, eyes still on the terminal. “But it’s unresolved. Routing continuity can’t just switch audit chains.”

Hero frowned. “Wait, what does that mean?”

The officer didn’t look up:
"It means your cert is still legally part of the original flow. Nothing moves unless that flow either closes or continues.”

Legal AI chimed in — voice smooth, with a slight buffer pause:

“Routing chain remains unresolved, so no new chain can be initiated. Legal options are:
— Await arbitration outcome (no transfers permitted in meantime)
— Custodial reassignment
— Temporary carry-forward via continuity binding”

The Navy clerk shifted awkwardly. The insurer rep scrolled through dispute flags, visibly annoyed.

“We’re not assuming custody,” the rep said. “This isn’t our manifest. Not our cert.”

“We can’t take it either,” the clerk muttered. “He’s not one of ours. And his contractor status doesn't extend to new transfer.”

The officer exhaled. “And extending the status - would that hold?”

The AI answered:

“If assigned as continuity entity under fallback extension rules — yes. Requires standard contract, authorized for current classification level.”

The room smelled like ozone and stale coffee.

Nobody wanted the cert, it was quite clear by now. The situation was both a liability and embarassement already. But they needed someone to hold it.

The officer turned to Hero. “Are you eligible for the extension?”

He raised a brow. “Technically, yes. That a formal offer?”

“Not yet,” she said. “Just a question.”

Everyone was silent again for a moment.

Then the officer said, without looking at him: AI, start prep. Offer, contract, all standard forms. Usual channels, but fast-track if you can.”

“Acknowledged.” the AI said. "Submitted for review. Also forwarded to Navy legal liaison to expedite the procedure."

Hero blinked. 

No one had asked if he was available. That seemed to be happening a lot lately.


## Chapter 5

The invitation came mid-morning. Proper header. Proper tone.

SUBJECT: CONTRACT STATUS REVIEW
TIME: 15:30 STATION TIME
LOCATION: DECK C – NAVAL ADMIN BLOCK / ROOM 112B
CLEARANCE: REQUIRED
PRESENCE EXPECTED

He tapped to acknowledge, then set it aside. There was no urgency tag. No coercive language. Just formality.

By the time he reached the admin block, the hallway outside 112B was lit bright and even. Cameras logged his approach. Standard signage above the door read: Personnel Clearance / Asset Reclassification.

Not high-traffic. But monitored. The kind of room no one entered without the schedule knowing.

Inside, the setup was basic but clean. Standard desk. Fabric dividers. Stationary scanner on a pivot bracket. A laminated hazard poster hung above the desk — listing risk classifications, response tiers, and PPE zones. The kind of thing no one read unless they had to sign under it.

A thermal printer hummed behind the desk.

The clerk — Navy, admin branch, maybe third tier — gestured him in without standing.

“You’re here about the continuity chain? Good.” She tapped a field on her slate. “We can’t finalize the routing authority unless you’re cleared for temporary billet.”

Hero blinked. “Billet?”

“Not career. Not enlistment.” She pointed to the screen. “Administrative Naval Classification 17-c. Used for irregular logistics where chain-bound audit personnel are required for manifest compliance. It grants temporary routing clearance.”

Her tone stayed dry, but practiced.
“The billet is non-renewable. Expires automatically upon return from the designated transfer mission — no post-deployment obligations. Duration is projected at seven to nine weeks, depending on orbital drift and transit stacking.”

He said nothing.

“You’d receive billet pay in addition to your contractor rate,” she added. “Zone differential applies. No pension weight. And it’ll log as ‘non-career attached personnel’ for conflict filtering.”

Then, almost as an afterthought:

“If you decline, the fallback cert may be flagged as inactive. That could require chain rollback or revalidation. Would also affect your eligibility for Navy compliance bids.”

Hero looked at the terminal. Then back at the clerk.

“You offering this as a choice?”

She shrugged, like it didn’t matter either way.

“The offer’s on record. You’re free to accept it.”

He didn’t move.

The clerk clicked through two more fields, then handed him a thermal patch.

PROV17-c: TEMP

He took the patch but didn’t put it on.

The scanner on the desk chirped twice, prompting him to align his ID chip. He hesitated. Then did.

The scanner tone confirmed:
CLASSIFICATION UPDATED: PROVISIONAL 17-c (TEMPORARY)
STATUS: CHAIN-BOUND PERSONNEL
TRAVEL LIMITATIONS: ACTIVE
COMMS: RESTRICTED TO ESSENTIAL CONTRACT INTERFACE

Hero stared at the screen. Not alarmed. Not surprised. Just tired.

He blinked once. A pause, not quite hesitation. Just system lag in his own head.

The printer buzzed again and spat out a single folded sheet — not bound, not stapled. Just folded and marked:

"Guidelines for TempNav Integration" - Probably basic regulations and such.

The clerk didn’t comment. She just pointed to the chair.

“Someone’ll be in to finalize the manifest scope. You’re authorized to wait here or in the hall.”

He stayed.

Ten minutes later, the logistics officer from yesterday stepped in. Same uniform. Same clipped posture.

She looked at the patch still in his hand. Then at him.

“You didn’t have to stay in person,” she said, dryly. “But it helps the paperwork.”

Hero didn’t respond.

She continued: “It’s just transit duty. Arbitration should clear before the next quarter cycle anyway.”

He finally asked, “What if I’d declined?”

The officer gave a sad-smile. “There’s always a form for refusing. Just none for undoing what that triggers.”

She paused, then added — not unkindly:

“You weren’t scapegoated, just a least problem. You will be paid and back to your life soon.”

Hero didn’t answer. He unfolded the pamphlet, didn’t read it, then folded it again. Filed it under his backup cert directory:
onboarding/

Not because it mattered. Just from habit.


## Chapter 6

Dock Cluster 3 still smelled like frost-burn scent from leaked glycol.

Two berths were active, technically. Four were sealed behind mesh barricades, their diagnostics long expired. A portable LN₂ scrub tower hissed behind mesh. One bracket vibrated against its bolt with a steady, high-pitched whine.

Hero stood just behind the staging rail. His boots hovered half a step back from the yellow line — station standard: safe if still watching. Pallet three was cycling down — final purge, seal re-lock, ID fallback. The drone completed its sweep without drama. It wasn’t moving the crate. Just re-freezing it.

The maintenance tech tapped once on his console and let the drone finish the sequence. His badge read *Cold Handling Oversight*, but he hadn’t spoken since Hero arrived. 

To Hero’s left, the routing officer crouched beside a crate. Stylus resting in one hand, elbow on knee. Still holding it like maybe there’d be another step. The stylus clicked twice against her slate. No input registered.

“Third purge this week,” she muttered. “Second that didn’t go anywhere. We burned two percent just on false starts.”

Hero didn’t answer. His slate was logging pressure deltas. Nothing outside range.

“Scrub tower went live before anyone checked coolant loss. Classic,” she said. “Three days in quarantine bumped temps just enough, now we’re stuck re-testing dampers on pumps that stall every third cycle.”

She didn’t sound angry. Just tired. Like someone who knew this wasn’t the first time.

Earlier that day, Navy had sent a logistics officer to supervise the prep cycle. Briefed like the window might still be saved. She stood through half the purge, scanned the delay log, and walked out when the manifest locked. No blame, no venting.

“They pulled the manifest,” the routing officer said. “Didn’t even signal the bay. Just locked it.”

Hero flicked through the compliance shell. No alerts. Cold-storage mesh still read mandatory sub-230K, helping a portable cryo scrubber. 

Yet coolant degradation read 7.3%. Most of it accrued pre-cycle. Every month in station storage would bleed another nine — versus one in a specialized deep-freeze hold.

Tolerance window looked fine for everyone - until the quarantine. And by insurance clause, coolant degradation beyond 15% voids optical calibration guarantee.

“The tug would have missed the orbital sling,” the officer added. “Next thrust window is in twelve days. Couldn't really waited that long.”

The drone docked itself. Indicator light dimmed. A nearby screen blinked once:

OPS BULLETIN  
ORV-52 MANIFEST FROZEN AT L-24
PALLETS QLA-777 EXCLUDED

The officer snorted. “Didn’t even ping the bay.”

Hero saved the bulletin to his slate. Appended it to the audit thread. No comment. Same cert anchor.

The scrub tower sighed as pressure monitors looped into self check. Looked like it was on auto now — purge done.

“They’ll try again next slot,” she said, finally leaning her head back. “Or scrap it and rewrite upstream. Doesn’t matter to us.”

Hero didn’t answer. He checked the hash chain again. Still anchored to him. Still marked “custodial witness.”

The tech exhaled quietly and walked off. The drone’s indicator light dimmed.

Another update rolled in. This time on his slate.

STATUS: PROV17-c
CONTINUITY STATUS: AUTO-EXTENDED (§7-c)
DURATION: PENDING NEW DEPARTURE MANIFEST

He stared at it a second longer than necessary. No one had even called him yet.

Something in his stomach shifted — the kind of pause you feel when a system just hangs, with no error message.

Then copied the whole log to a new folder:
/continuity/qla777/late_prep_02/

The routing officer didn’t look up.

“They’ll leave you on it,” she said. Not kindly. Not unkindly. Just the obvious.

Hero nodded once. 

# Chapter 7

The civil kiosk flickered under mismatched backlights. A row of terminals, all functional, none clean. Casings sweat-dull from touch. QR stickers curled at the edges, half-detached from the tray lining. A lone service drone hovered nearby, stamping forms with slow mechanical clicks. A poster behind the glass read "Continuity Questions? Ask your Liaison AI — they’ll help if unsure." in three languages. Someone had crossed out “help” and scribbled “log it” in its place.

Hero tapped into Terminal 3. His ID pinged before his finger touched the slate. Two tabs opened: Status & Services and Open Matters.  

He found Grievance Forms nested three layers deep.

Drop-down menu. Category: “Contract Terms & Conditions.”
Subfield: “Unexpected Modification.”
He typed:
“Request advice on whether the unilateral extension is binding, and what options for recourse exist.”
Then attached his contract file.

His billet had extended by an estimated eight months. The Navy had rerouted the shipment onto Convoy S-21 — a fuel-efficient spiral run that looped Ganymede before swinging to Enceladus. Round-trip: two hundred days, give or take.

Hit submit.

The screen blinked once. For five seconds, nothing happened — just a visual of a folder opening, checkboxes ticking themselves into infinity.

Then:

CIV-CASE-REF 18-55251
STATUS: RECEIVED AND FORWARDED
ROUTE: MIL-OMBUDS (Rule CS-M2-17)
REASON: Active military matter (Continuity Code §7-c)

The drone’s arm hissed. Two label-chits dropped onto the tray — thin laminate, each tagged with a code and expiry glyph. One landed crooked. The real copy had already synced to his slate.

A second message appeared. Liaison AI:

“Complaint logged. Status: Deferred — routed to military ombuds under §7-c.”

He printed a copy anyway. Pressed it flat and slid it into his slate pouch. Print made it more tangible. The synced version was already filed next to the billet contract.

He was already at the right kiosk. Swiped into Visitor Access. A pre-registered pass was waiting — his niece's name already matched: Lena Kohrs.

Visitor Day-Pass — Type C
Purpose: Family Visit 
Affiliation: PolyHelix Observatory (Academic)
Access Window: 24 Hours (Auto-Expires at 11:24 STN Time)

The printer whined once, cut a strip.

Her name was just slightly off-center. Station formatting always left something misaligned. The pass was utterly routine and already on record. Both his checking and the hard-copy completely redundant.

He slipped it into his outer pocket anyway. Walked the corridor marked “Hab Ring East,” past two closed cafés and a bulkhead repair tag that had peeled halfway off. The old signage still mentioned three blocs that no longer funded the station.

She was already at the rail, boots hooked into the restraint lip, body angled forward to catch the view. Glass panels arched upward into a soft parallax dome.

Earth and Moon sat in close alignment — Luna pale, Tycho Crater sharp in the foreground; Earth a faint blue disk tucked just behind. Sol hovered low along the horizon line, casting soft edge light across both.

She glanced back, smiled. “Hey.”

“Hey.”

She passed him a foil cube. “Crew motel said this is flight-stable coffee. Tastes like mud.”

“Thanks.”

He took it, felt the corner dented in from packaging. Didn’t open it.

They watched the view. Off-axis, two other L5 stations drifted in lazy orbit — one a fuel relay, blinking thermal beacons for tanker approach; the other a dim comms node, bristling with cubesat pylons and shortwave dishes. Hers wasn’t visible — the PolyHelix academic rig sat parked on the far loop, out of gallery line-of-sight.

They stood there a few minutes, watching traffic overlay drift across the dome glass — L5 shuttle arcs, relay updates, fuel reserve markers. She asked about the hab food. He asked how long her academic tour had left. Both answered like people who hadn’t practiced small talk in a while.

After a while, she half-joked,
“So. How’s the Navy?”

Hero didn’t look away from the dome.
“Not Navy. Just a routing contract.”

She smiled. “Sure. Temporary sailor.”

“Provisional billet. Ends with the shipment.”

“How long’s that?”

He hesitated. “Eight months, give or take. Could shift.”

A soft pause.

"It’s weird how you make all your procedures… work in layers. Like nested folders."

Hero looked over.

She grinned. Not unkindly.

“I’m serious,” she said.

Hero started to reply, didn’t. 

"You ever get bored?"

"Only when I'm off duty," he replied.

They drifted back into small talk. She asked about his bunk, his terminal, what was there to do on the station. He showed her the galley where he always ate — same corner seat, same rice packet. They shared a meal there. She teased him for his meals. He didn’t deny it.

He walked her back to the shuttle loop — his steps rhythmic, almost like light exercise; hers casual, hands tucked in her vest pockets. Her slate was already blinking a soft return prompt.

At the airlock, she hugged him goodbye — quick, one-armed, familiar. The surprise made him flinch. He recovered quickly, yet regretted it before she let go.

She gave a backwards wave at the turn. He raised a hand — too slow to time it.

Later that night, her message was waiting. No subject line.

"Glad to have seen you. This place makes you small." With it, a sketch - a quick, childish drawing of a space station, lopsided and ringed in caution tape.

Hero tagged it: overlay/custom_user-asset.

Foldered it under: /sentimentals/.

Then opened a reply window. Typed:

“Good to see you. Hope your boots held up.”

Sat with it. Cursor blinking.

Tagged the draft: unfiled/personal_pending.

Never sent.


# Chapter 8 

Dock A-5 had been cleared for the transfer. One overhead beacon pulsed dim — station standby cycle. Frost traced the pressure seals on the outer cargo cradle, still waiting its turn in the maintenance queue to bring insulation back to spec. Two cargo-bay drones hovered idle nearby — logistics pattern, hull glyphs blinking slow.

The pallets sat aligned in lock position, stencil tags slightly askew from re-handling. They’d been rechecked twice already — once by drone, once by human.

Hero walked the access track with his slate already open. Temperature deltas, vibration logs, chain hashes — all within range. His certificate hovered pinned in corner-view, hash auto-refreshing every few seconds. He re-scanned it anyway, just to be sure.

The station logistics chief signed first — chipped nail, slate edge smudged. The Kite’s Wake supply officer tapped his stylus absently, waiting for the prompt. Hero signed last.

Some polite but flat exchanges had gone quiet minutes ago — the specialists already thinking ahead to their next task. Just triple confirm, sequential hash ping.

The third hash took a half-beat longer than it should’ve. Hero pretended not to notice. The supply officer checked his slate again before nodding.

Kite's Wake was a small ion patrol corvette slotted into S-21 convoy’s low-thrust profile as its only escort. Her xenon tanks gave her plenty of margin for the same spiral as the cargo haulers, allowing plenty extra maneuvers if needed. It wasn't about non-existent  pirates. It was about projecting authority.

Her transponder granted bloc legitimacy. Her command seal joined the audit ledger to a formal hierarchy. Insurance terms changed the moment she signed CEA-45 escort log. No one expected her to fire a shot. She existed to keep the data admissible, the manifest sovereign, and the mission insurable.

Presence was cheaper than arbitration. Especially when the hull was already paid for — and every presence logged now could be cited as future precedent. Presence meant posture. Posture meant leverage. Few patrol loops today, better seat at political table tomorrow.

Cryogenics telemetry matched the latest freeze-log. Cert chain closed. Still anchored to Hero’s fallback cert — unavoidable now, and for the foreseeable future.

The cryo-locker HUD flipped:
`AMBER → GREEN`

The captain’s signed acknowledgment arrived half a minute later — delayed in the comms queue. The escort contract was now official.

Hero checked his slate again. The assignment still read unreal: 
PAO–NC
(Provisional Audit Officer – Non-Commissioned)

Navy crest greyed and view-locked.

The yeoman met him at the brow. She wore ship-standard soft boots — silent tread on metal grating. At the quarterdeck scanner, her slate pinged. Hero’s ID confirmed.

His own slate pushed a soft-badge:

PAO / SUPERNUMERARY—017C
Compliance Clearance: TIER-3-LOG (Read/Write – Audit & Cargo)
No Command Authority

She handed him a vinyl lanyard sleeve — orange-striped. He clipped it to his collar, then touched it again without thinking. Familiar from past interactions with the navy — but he’d never expected to wear one himself.

He wore the same charcoal coverall as the crew — no braid, no rank stripes. Just the PAO–SUPERNUM patch above his chest zip, and the bloc crest stitched to his right shoulder. The orange sleeve tag was the only thing that marked him as not crew.

And his boots. Civilian issue, passed safety spec. He didn’t like them much. But they were his.

The yeoman led him the short walk to the wardroom — barely two dozen paces on a ship this size. Inside, the captain and XO stood by the wall slate, reviewing pre-departure checklists. They didn’t pause — just turned when the door clicked.

The captain — Lieutenant Commander by insignia, dark-eyed, precise — nodded once.
“Welcome aboard. You’re Auditor Kohrs?”

Hero nodded. “Provisional, yes. Venn Kohrs.”

“This is Lieutenant Rhian, my executive officer.”

The XO, older, sleeves half-rolled, gave a brief nod — already holding the slate packet. He extended it to Hero. The label read:

Kite’s Wake — PAO Logistics SOP (Abridged)

“We’ll keep you on the logistics net,” the captain added, eyes back on the wall display. “You will send your reports through the XO. Bring me only the exceptions.”

"Yeoman Solis will give you the quick tour and show you your berth. Lieutenant Rhian will forward the full logistics packet. You’re expected to absorb it before we clear station. That will be all, Auditor."

No friction. No welcome either.

Yeoman Solis led him through the essentials — maybe ten minutes, tops. Brisk pace, practiced route. Compact build, buzz-cut under the rim of her duty cap. She spoke just enough to orient, not enough to invite questions.

Several nodes flashed red on his overlay with "NO ENTRY" label as they passed them:
REACTOR TRUNK
MAG PATH
WEAPONS GRID
COMMAND CORE

She paused at the basics — lav module, galley, sick-bay. Emergency routes. The mess was half-lit, two crew mid-meal. They looked up just long enough to clock his collar tag, then went back to eating. Conversation dipped as they passed, resumed before the door fully closed.

Then she lingered longer over anything tied to his billet.
Cargo Control still smelled faintly of old sealant; she pointed to the intake fans where the haze always settled. The cryo telemetry board glowed soft amber — still in pre-maneuver lockout.

At the cargo bay viewport, she showed him the grapple status and locker delta readouts.

“Your load’s in Cryo Bay Three — port-side cradle, seal tag eight-eight-two Kilo,” she said. “Telemetry’s routed to your audit stream.”

Last, she tapped the hatch beside his assigned berth. “Records node’s here. Your slate’s keyed for read access. Write access flagged to your cert.”

The records room came last — one hatch down from his berth, secured with a mechanical latch and a keycode pad.

“Retention node runs local delta syncs every four hours,” she said. “If you need the full ledger, request node access through Records.”

Then she handed off the cabin code and left.

His cabin was a spare two-rack near Records. One bunk was already claimed — locker closed, boots tucked beneath, and a name stencil half-faded on the upper hatch: KERR / SENSORS.

No sign of the occupant.

The other bunk was still vacuum-sealed. Locker stencil:
SUPERNUM 2R – PAO

His slate pinged. The XO’s doc-packet landed in his inbox. The list was already growing:
- Treaty Inspection Quick-Ref  
- Naval Data-Retention Matrix  
- Emergency Muster Procedures 

He tagged the folder “baseline_refs”. Told himself he’d read it tonight.

While still deciding what to read first, the folder gained six more files.

# Chapter 9

Hero was walking the cradle rail again — re-scanning overlays, spot-checking telemetry. He was double-checking crate tags when he noticed the marker.

His slate showed a soft-flag on Pallet 882-Kilo — logged two cargo transfers back, never cleared. A 7-bit mismatch in the vibration telemetry checksum. Could’ve been rounding drift. Or mishandling. Probably nothing.

He ran a complete system integrity check — crate tags, telemetry, and internal logs. He ran a sequential hash check and cross-checked vibration logs against backup sensors.

There it was, the same mismatch. 

Under §7-c regs, a certified custodial witness had to flag any chain fault before final seal. No leeway. Hero soft-tagged the packet and attached the override. He ordered a rerun and pushed it to the departure log.

The HUD blinked once, then held.

LOCKER 882-KILO
VIBRATION CRC MISMATCH — RETRY RECOMMENDED
STATUS: NONCONFIRMED – §7-C HOLD

Pump-down sequence froze.

One of the cryo lines gave a low knock — pressure normalization halted mid-loop. A fan cycled behind the bulkhead, louder than it should’ve felt.

The bay went still. One of the techs glanced over, then back at his checklist.

The Launch-Status feed on the bulkhead flipped from READY to HOLD, and the impulse-thruster warm-up bar halted halfway through.

Thirty seconds passed. Then the XO’s voice cut in, flat.

“Kohrs. That should’ve cleared before ignition loop. Stand by.”

What followed wasn’t subtle.

XO scrambled the sequence, to keep thruster warm-up and navigation hand-off within convoy cadence. Engineering vented a micro-burst of xenon to hold berth alignment, creating an “unplanned thruster event” log the captain now had to sign. 

Hero stayed where he was. Slate steady. His lanyard sleeve visible. Posture neutral. Thumb on his cuff seam.

No one spoke to him, but a launch tech leaned slightly away — not intentionally, just a reflex.

On rerun, the mismatch cleared. CRC realigned. Locker 882 flipped GREEN with five minutes to spare.

Cargo control, shipwide:
"Bridge, Cargo — hold released, locker 882 green."

Captain, calm:
“Bridge copies. Resuming sequence.”

Hero tapped his initials into the hold record and closed the slate.

A few hours later, departure was complete. Convoy alignment confirmed, thruster cycle logged, navigation relay handed off. The crew stood down to normal routines.

Briefing came just before morning sequence.

Wardroom lights were still dimmed. Captain’s stylus rapped once on the tabletop.

Captain, flat: 
“We vented point-two kilos of xenon to hold berth and missed convoy hand-off by a full minute. XO, walk me through it.

XO replied: 
“CRC mismatch on 882-Kilo. Auditor triggered a §7-c hold, reran full hash. Second pass cleared green.”

Chief Engineer added: 
“Extra xenon vent logged and balanced. Delta-V negligible.”

The captain turned to Hero. Paused. Then, in a flat, precise tone:
“Auditor. Next time run your deep dive before the departure sequence.”

He looked at Hero — not with malice, but carefully measured.
“You had the authority. But the timing cut close.”

Hero nodded. No defense. No reply. The clause had been clear. So had the tone.

Captain initialed the amended packet—stylus strike loud in the quiet room—and slid it back.
“That’s all.”

Nothing changed after that — not officially. But his ID took half a second longer at every scanner. 

And a few times, when entering control bays, someone else seemed to be just stepping out.
