## Author’s World-View

|Theme or Rule|Notes|
|---|---|
|**Humans never change**|Same fears, pride, petty grievances, from caves to orbital habitats.|
|**Utopias don’t exist**|Because human incentives & flaws grind them down. Attempts to enforce them often breed soft or hard tyranny.|
|**People are brutal if unchecked**|Survival instincts are primal. Humanity is apex predator for a reason. Both individuals and groups have a “kill switch.”|
|**Everyone is self-interested, but irrationally so**|People build personal worldviews mainly to justify shortcomings, so often act against real interests while feeling they’re defending them.|
|**Most people stop evolving surprisingly early**|They keep doing what worked once, decades past relevance. Looks absurd to outsiders, but it’s normal.|
|**History, tech, culture aren’t linear**|Not a march of progress. Roman engineers or scribes were the same minds in different tech contexts.|
|**Politics run in cycles**|Cycles between populist waves (emotional, promising simple solutions, often scapegoating) and hard-liner phases (rigid, technocratic or authoritarian corrections). Each is a reaction to the excesses of the last.|
|**Generations run in cycles**|Often roughly four phases: idealistic builders, comfortable consolidators, cynical dismantlers, fearful restorers. The “Fourth Turning” captures part of this — you’re skeptical of its “inevitable cataclysm,” but the generational pendulum rings true.|
|**Most people act shocked by cycles**|Despite them being natural and repeated through history, people believe each phase is permanent.|
|**Everyone ultimately lives off competence, reputation, communication**|Strip systems down, and survival or success depends on these three.|
|**Tarot & I Ching matter because they give you signals from yourself**|They act as external mirrors — often more objective than “you,” who is clouded by being inside the problem. They pull up how your subconscious thinks things will work out if you handle it in the same way you usually do.|
|**Most underestimate incentives, overestimate utopias**|Leads to repeated disappointments and doomed grand schemes.|
|**Soft censorship is most effective**|Social norms and fears shape speech and thought long before formal repression is needed.|
|**Challenging narratives brings punishment**|Disagreement makes you a target, quickly cast as the enemy. Timeless.|
|**True beliefs leak via sarcasm, micro-signals**|Real agreement or dissent only surfaces where there’s trust, often signaled in jokes or subtle cues.|
|**Best improvisers are also meticulous planners**|They value planning not for rigid execution, but to prepare the mind for rapid adjustment.|
|**Plans always break; reality demands improv**|Systems that “fail fast” are better — they reveal faults early. Same for stories & characters.|
|**Systems become self-preserving**|Bureaucracies, institutions, even ideas develop instincts to survive beyond their usefulness.|
|**Big systems self-balance, but with wild swings**|Not stable; dynamic churn that finds temporary equilibriums.|
|**Tech doesn’t fix human flaws**|Greed, fear, status games remain, only with shinier tools.|
|**Short-term thinking dominates**|Most chase immediate gains, undermining future stability.|
|**Maintenance matters more than fireworks**|Real power is in quietly keeping things running, not grand launches.|
|**People over-rely on tools, especially mediocre individuals**|They believe the tool will do the work for them, avoid learning fundamentals, then are shocked when it fails. The tool reflects their incompetence, not replaces it.|
|**Positioning often matters more than execution**|Being in the right spot, or setting up the right angles, trumps perfect plans or flawless implementation. Many who win simply stood where the opportunity passed.|
|**Most people avoid taking responsibility for their circumstances**|It’s more comforting to blame fate, politics, the past, or “the system.” Owning up would require hard self-reckoning.|
|**That’s why role models, religions, movements are so popular**|They let people outsource responsibility: “I’m just following this higher authority,” or “it’s not my fault if this fails, it’s what we all do.”|
|**Most people are sheep, some are dogs**|The majority follow social norms or herds. A smaller subset organizes, polices, manages — like shepherd dogs.|
|**Some fraction of each are predators**|A natural minority in both groups are almost sociopathic — seeing others purely as resources, obstacles, or toys. They thrive because most sheep & dogs can’t fathom such unfiltered self-interest.|
|**Most people never truly learn money, communication, relationships, or the other sex**|Even though these are arguably the most important knowledge areas for everything in life. Most stumble through on default scripts, half-understood instincts, or cultural clichés — and are shocked by the consequences.|
|**Nobody is evil. Everyone is right in some way.**|Nobody (bare psychopats) wokes up as a villain. Conflict arises when two opposing parties are both acting on otherwise perfectly normal, mundane and legitimate needs and incentives. Everyone is just protecting their own, preventing a disaster, or just making sure their kid’s tuition gets paid.|

## World State & Core Canon

### World is like hyper-today

**World arc** - Hyper-today: similar geopolitical blocks, capitalism + rival systems, same religions (but somewhat avoided in the story), core worries are economy / environment / security. Heavily automated (drones, AI aids), but **AGI never quite arrived.** Everything driven by incentives, logistics, old fears in shiny new suits.

### Core Canon

|**Topic**|**Key Points**|
|---|---|
|**AI & Automation**|• No AGI — only countless narrow AIs drafting layered recommendations, almost never executing major decisions by law and culture. <br> • Reliance varies: some regions let their “mesh” plan nearly everything, others enforce heavy human oversight. <br> • Corporations, agencies, and lobbies fund rival expert systems, driving constant clashes over whose “optimal” plan wins. <br> • Most jobs revolve around steering or auditing AIs, even skilled trades supervise drones. <br> • Complex field work stays mixed crews — humans make judgment calls, drones act as hands and eyes.|
|**Computers & Cloud**|• No one says “computer” — wearables handle local processing, walls or glasses display it, heavy work runs on tiered cloud slices. <br> • Basic cloud/AI access is a civil right but also a subtle control lever; states can throttle or favor usage. <br> • Privacy is stratified: top tiers get armored data vaults, low tiers are so porous they’re nearly public. <br> • Sharing is instant and risky, spawning everyday scams and subtle manipulation.|
|**Digital Currency**|• Digital e-currencies are universal, but cash still clings on for small local buys; large cash deals trigger audits. <br> • States use currencies to shape behavior — micro taxes, nudges, transaction frictions — mostly accepted unless blatantly rigged. <br> • Small evasions are normal: IOUs, barter, loyalty credits, discreet cash topping. <br> • Privacy and circumvention depend on means; most dodge, adapt, or comply as needed.|
|**Energy & Industry**|• Modular fission is widespread but uneven; some regions refuse it, stuck on imports or old fuels. <br> • Renewables were overbuilt in panic booms, now costly to maintain with odd local price spikes and blackout risks. <br> • Oil & hydrogen still power heavy transport and industry, their networks remain geopolitical fault lines. <br> • Fusion is flashy but non-viable — prestige demos feed speculation, not grids. <br> • Grid reliability varies wildly: some cities run stable microgrids, others face brownouts, fuel mafias, and hidden insurance costs.|
|**Climate & Environment**|• Earth’s glacial cycles lurk behind forecasts; even a modest cooling could drop seas, dry interiors, and strain economies long before true ice ages. <br> • Policies stay contradictory: seawalls and carbon capture boom alongside new fossil pushes, each side cherry-picks models. <br> • Local responses follow incentives: rich coastlines fund defenses, inland zones chase drought tweaks, unstable states sell out for quick gains. <br> • Cultures fracture: urban youth push degrowth, elites build tech buffers, rural areas stick to tradition until collapse forces change.|
|**CRISPR & Biotech**|• Mild edits are routine — fixing birth defects, small immunity boosts — seen as normal medicine. <br> • Anything beyond that is taboo, heavily restricted, and widely believed to be technically out of reach. <br> • Still, persistent rumors swirl about smarter or stronger engineered elites, though evidence is murky and often dismissed as conspiracy or status envy. <br> • Most people feel a mix of unease and fascination, treating deep edits as half-myth, half-threat.|
|**Population & Labor**|• Global population has peaked and begun to decline, aging across most regions with fewer young workers. <br> • Many simple or repetitive roles have vanished under automation, replaced by hybrid oversight or niche service work. <br> • People still work long careers — often into their 80s — with subtle social or economic penalties for stepping out, even if raw survival needs less labor. <br> • Partial basics and local supports soften desperation but don’t erase it; reputation and small economic perks drive most to stay active. <br> • Different cultures fill the gap variously: local co-ops, prestige projects, subtle status competitions, or low-key decadence.|
|**Wealth & Inequality**|• Tech and finance have widened gaps: the rich buy better biotweaks, deeper cloud contracts, and somewhat longer vitality — while ordinary people patch together modest upgrades or partial protections. <br> • Mega-corporations are larger and more powerful than today, but still operate within the push and pull of major states — cutting deals, paying fines, shaping policy rather than outright replacing governments. <br> • Power is transactional and layered through bureaucracies and influence webs, not overt oligarch rule. <br> • Status still rests on competence, reputation, and communication — but elite circles play on easier mode with stacked advantages.|
|**Space & Naval**|• Launch costs have dropped through relentless optimization, making small crewed ships and cargo runs viable — but still rare and massively insured. <br> • Used for zero-g manufacturing, asteroid extraction, and fragile patrol navies that exist more to reassure investors and regulators than fight wars. <br> • Each ship loss or major accident shakes markets and politics, with insurance and risk derivatives playing outsized roles. <br> • Legal and regulatory chaos is constant: disputes over inspections, taxes, labor rights, and sabotage keep fleets tied up in courts as much as in orbit.|
|**Culture & Daily Life**|• Many people rely on deeply personalized AI companions — part assistant, therapist, confidant, and subtle manipulator — filling social, emotional, and organizational gaps without judgment. <br> • Status games and small ideological hobby wars still dominate social life, now filtered through these AI lenses that learn personal biases and reinforce them. <br> • Young people often struggle to find stable starts, drifting between patchy gigs, reputation plays, or informal local economies. <br> • Regional cultures adapt differently: some double down on high-tech immersion and companion culture, others flaunt low-tech or human-only lifestyles as status rebellion. <br> • Underneath it all, the same human drives persist: fear, pride, petty grievances — just channeled through slick new interfaces.|
|**Generational Cycles**|• The world is still run by older leaders who built or managed massive climate and energy projects decades ago — proud of stabilizing society, clinging to those old narratives of success. <br> • Their children, now middle-aged, grew up under big programs and social campaigns, raised to keep systems running smoothly and avoid major risks — cautious, process-focused, trying to perfect what exists. <br> • Young adults are more skeptical and practical, shaped by seeing bloated systems, patchy failures, and quiet corruption; they value competence, shortcuts, and personal networks over big slogans. <br> • Teenagers and kids, growing up just as alien hints start surfacing, will inherit a different world — likely pushing for more collective or ambitious projects in reaction to their parents’ wary pragmatism, if crises deepen.|

### Key concepts expanded

#### **AI – General Canon**

**Advanced Artificial Systems** in this setting are highly capable in analysis, fact aggregation, and procedural execution. They can:

- Process and synthesize complex datasets at speeds unattainable by humans.
    
- Interpret laws, regulations, and treaties to a high degree of nuance.
    
- Prepare complete decision packets with recommended actions.
    

**Limitations:**

- Cannot enact non-routine, binding decisions without a human signatory or explicit pre-authorization.
    
- May execute routine actions autonomously **only** if the parameters are fully defined in statute or policy, and the action is legally classified as procedural.
    
- All non-routine actions require either:
    
    - Active human approval, or
        
    - Passive ratification via expiry of a legally mandated veto window.
        

**Design Rationale:**

- Public trust is maintained by keeping humans as the nominal decision-makers for sensitive or precedent-setting matters.
    
- Efficiency is maximized by allowing AIs to handle the 90–99% of work that is procedural, repetitive, and low-discretion.
    

#### **Avatars – Applied AI Example**

**Definition:**

- A legally recognized class of advanced procedural AI authorized to act as _formal representatives_ in specific domains where accuracy, procedural alignment, and speed are valued over direct human presence.
    

**Shared Traits:**

- **Representation:** Can stand in for a registered human or entity in defined legal, regulatory, or contractual processes.
    
- **Bounded Authority:**
    
    - May execute routine actions **autonomously** if parameters are fully defined in statute, contract, or policy.
        
    - All other actions require **human ratification** — either active approval or passive expiry of a veto window.
        
- **High Procedural Competence:** Specialized in aligning facts with governing rules, preparing fully formed filings, and ensuring compliance artifacts are audit-ready.
    
- **Human-facing Interface:** Usually embodied via telepresence or projection for hearings, negotiations, and formal exchanges.
    

**Specializations (examples):**

- **Legal Avatars:** Handle hearings, arbitration prep, treaty compliance filings.
    
- **Logistics Avatars:** Manage port clearances, chain-of-custody validations, scheduling disputes.
    
- Medical Compliance Avatars: Oversee regulatory certifications, cross-border health clearance.
    
    (Other sectors adapt the model as permitted by law.)
    

**Cultural Context:**

- **Trusted for process, not for judgment** — valued for speed and accuracy, but culturally unacceptable as sole arbiters in high-discretion matters.
    
- **Institutional Preference:** Widely deployed in insurance, navy, corporate, and municipal functions for their throughput.
    
- **Public Comfort:** Acceptance hinges on the visible ratification brake — without it, use becomes politically risky.
    

**Avatars in Bureaucratic Space:**

- Each avatar instance has a **fixed face, tone, and mannerisms**; these cannot be altered once deployed.
    
- Avatars are known by their **alias** (e.g. _Ledger-Broin_, _PolyHelix-Dante_), not personal names.
    
- Every avatar must wear/display a badge for instant recognition, consisting of:
    
    1. Institution Seal/Logo (the entity it represents).
    
    2. Functional Stripe/Color Code (compliance, finance, military, etc.).
    
    3. Instance ID (the unique instance designation).
    
- Replacement of an instance with a different one serves as an **implicit signal of change** — often read as a deliberate policy shift or institutional pivot.
    

### Anti-trope table

|**Category**|**What To Avoid / Specific Risks**|**Solution / Strategy**|
|---|---|---|
|**Tech & Society Defaults**|Generic “cyberpunk-lite” overlays, status games, long-lived bored masses, retro youth, interchangeable with countless dystopias.|Keep overlays but make them **fragile, often glitchy, or locally banned**; show people using them for petty, irrational reasons (status envy, local politics).|
|**AI & Automation**|Expert systems run everything while humans decay or scheme, no tension or surprise.|Invert: **AIs can’t execute — only recommend at lightning speed, humans must sign off**. So incompetent people bottleneck brilliant systems.|
|**Space = Age of Sail**|Pirates, insurance & legal chaos replaying merchant marine tropes.|Twist: **“Pirates” are lawyers, insurers, or micro-state navies exploiting loopholes & paperwork seizures.** Actual shipboard mutiny is rare & shocking.|
|**Black Markets & Surveillance**|Neon contraband scenes & shallow hackers as standard rebellion.|Make it **gray-market by default — like socialist barter: everyone trades off books, apps, meds.** No slick rebels, just ordinary hustle.|
|**Climate Flip-Flop**|Simple overheat → ice age toggle echoing old eco collapse stories.|Keep cycles but highlight **chaotic local policies, rival geoengineering cults, or regional denial movements** that make global strategy impossible.|
|**Decadent Longevity**|Old rich vs decaying basics, classic transhuman divide.|Narrow the tech: **rich live longer but not prettier — more decrepit, with support pods, afraid to be offline.** No graceful immortality.|
|**Emotional Shortcuts**|Tragic ship losses or quick betrayals for easy drama; cautious underdog survives as moral lesson.|Keep harsh events but show them as **logistics-driven accidents or slow-simmer schemes, not convenient gut-punchs.** And your hero’s survival is boring grind, not virtue.|
|**Generational Loops**|Cycles of builders → decadents → panickers as mere costume swaps.|Sharpen by showing **local exceptions:** pockets stuck two turns back, microcultures refusing the swing, some never get decadent at all.|
|**Tech as Hidden Utopia**|Overlays & implants patching all cracks, making it subtly utopian.|Explicitly show **overlays break down under stress, implants are regulated by fragile supply chains, most can’t afford serious mods.**|
|**Stock Scenes & Symbols**|VR-addled neon youths, big insurance tickers, pilots with family photos, shallow body mods.|Replace with **old men tracking insurance markets on paper ledgers, family photos as local altars, mods as functional desperation (arthritis relief)**.|
|**Shallow AI Naming**|“Mesh,” “agents,” etc. without exploring how people misuse or resent them.|Drill into how **locals curse or personify systems — “the mesh robbed me,” “my agents backstabbed me” — showing distrust & irrational blame.**|
