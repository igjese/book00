Lists things to fix

## Act-1

| Area | Edit Type  | Purpose / Rationale  | Example Cue or Use |
| - | -- | -- | - |
| **Scene Texture (Ch. 4–6)**  | *Micro-sensory variance*   | Avoid rhythmic sameness in pacing and atmosphere — 3 procedural scenes in a row risk tonal flatlining. Break the sensory monotony without breaking tone. | Introduce: background crowd murmur, overheard fragments, screen flicker, or mechanical vibration in one scene. Or place a scene in a slightly “livelier” environment (mess hall queue, customs wait area). |
| **Hero’s Micro-Decisions**   | *Highlight 1–2 personal actions*   | Emphasize Hero’s subtle agency. His arc is slow-moving, but *early signs of initiative or resistance* increase reader investment.    | Tag one redundant check he insists on doing. Show hesitation before deleting a file. Let him silently override something minor the system says is “acceptable.” One sentence is often enough.  |
| **Human Indifference**   | *Add quiet interpersonal friction* | Reinforce that the world isn’t just broken by automation — it’s also upheld by people who *look away*. Adds realism and tension triangulation.   | Let a compliance officer dismissively call him “the cert guy.” Or a clerk pause to explain — then choose not to. A tech may talk *around* him instead of *to* him. |
| **Inner Texture (1 moment)** | *Brief internalization or observation* | Cement reader’s intuitive sense of Hero. You don’t want warmth — just a revealing crack in his procedural mask.  | Insert 1–2 dry lines that show what he notices, or what he quietly registers but never says aloud. Could be a thought like: *“He filed the success report. It felt dishonest.”*    |
