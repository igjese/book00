# Face-of-antagonist characters (personas we can rotate)

1. **Embodied Authority** – A character (often mid-rank) who enforces the system but also has personal stakes.
	- They’re not evil; they believe they’re right, or have career/family reasons to oppose the protagonist.
2.  **The Reluctant Enforcer** – Someone who _likes_ the protagonist but is still bound to oppose them when rules say so.
3. **The Opportunist** – A peer or superior who uses the system’s inertia to advance themselves, so they _welcome_ the protagonist’s screw-ups as leverage.
4. **The “Echo”** – Someone who mirrors the protagonist’s skillset but uses it for the system’s ends, showing what the hero could become if they surrendered entirely to it.
5. **The Absent Hammer** – High command or political authority that never appears directly, but whose orders _always_ arrive at the worst moment — a constant off-stage presence creating pressure.


# TODO: Characters and entities we need

- A couple of non-bloc, non-Navy recurring personalities (journalists, legal specialists, contract troubleshooters) to tie political/economic beats back into Hero POVs without dumping exposition.
- At least one RC-era recurring character from each founding bloc, to humanize bloc politics.
- Someone who represents “the public” in recurring fashion — station merchant rep, NGO figure, or even a family member working in civilian space.
- Faces for blocs
- Faces for entities
- Specific station governments (some civilian-run, some Navy-run).
- Orbital yard authorities and fabrication unions.
- A couple of named shipping megacorps (beyond PolyHelix) so we can show competitive tension.
- RC bodies, like: secretariat, enforcement office, political council
- Antagonist & Ally Rotation per archetypes: which book they appear in, recurring vs one-off, bloc/nation identity
- One durable face per recurring entity

## Entities that would be normal to be there

* Orbital authorities: corridor authorities, station authorities
* Insurers / Insurance Cartels
* Navy command chain: local commands, regional commands, high command
* Navy bodies: admiralty, naval engineering buerau, regulatory & oversight bodies
* Conglomerates: Corporate coalitions running critical tech stations; politically entangled. Later also BioTech giants: pivot to alien-inspired microbial and plant biotech chains
* Poly-bloc bodies: Treaty oversight panel, Arbitration board, Science Consortium, regulatory & oversight bodies
* ECS bodies: Compliance Bureau, regulatory & oversight bodies
* Civilian bodies: syndicates, guilds, regulatory & oversight bodies, unions
* Media: anchors, independent streamers
* **Political Factions B11-12** -– Various blocs and coalitions using Hero’s name as cover, ballast, or weapon.
* **Major Dissident Groups & Factions B10-11** – Crushed in rare show of unity among powers.
# Character Roster

- **Captain B1** — procedural, duty-bound, reluctant to deviate from regs.
- **XO B1** — primary bridge antagonist, enforces protocol with teeth.
- **Veteran auditor B1 (Tethys)** — cynically competent, teaches fallback cert trick.
- **Logistics officer B1 (Relay 6)** — brushes him off / functional gatekeeper.
- **Lena Kohrs** - Venn's niece. Once bonded over her fascination with his fallback systems. Rarely in touch now but share mutual respect from that early moment
* **Admiral B7 (Old Contact)** – Veteran officer with bloc-committee influence; offers Hero low-profile roles.
- **Quiet almost-platonic soulmate** – Rare, coincidental meetings with a fellow cynic outside Navy bureaucracy. Dry mutual understanding, no warmth or romance, but deep trust.
- **Discreet transactional relationship** – Station professional with chronic health flag; he occasionally buries or reframes marginal results to keep her certified. Ritual evenings together, emotionally bounded.
- **Low-level AI fallback companion** – An old compliance overlay customized to his style; a safe, unchallenging echo chamber he occasionally jokes to.
* **Rival B4 (XO / 2nd-in-command)** – Ambitious officer, skeptical or hostile toward Hero’s methods.
* **Someone High Up B7** – Anonymous senior contact feeding Hero selective intel to trigger procedural consequences.
* **Head of RC B10** - politically implodes
* **RC Crisis Directors** – Ruthlessly competent crisis managers empowered by major powers.
* **Corporate Technical Executives** – Corporate equivalent of crisis directors; control alien-adjacent projects.
## Characters that would be normal to be there

- **Family as a whole** – Distant but intact. Mutual avoidance of emotional entanglement; contact mostly functional or ceremonial.
* **Brass** – Mid- to high-level command; sometimes supportive, always calculating.
